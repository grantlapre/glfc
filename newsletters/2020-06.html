      <p>This issue captures key developments across Anti‑Money Laundering (AML), Counter‑Financing of Terrorism (CFT), and Fraud &amp; Financial Crime as at 31 May 2020.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>AML — Regulatory &amp; Policy Developments</h2>
      <h3>European Commission unveils AML/CFT Action Plan (7 May)</h3>
      <p>The Commission published a six‑pillar Action Plan outlining an EU‑level AML authority, a single rulebook, stronger FIU coordination, and a 12‑month roadmap toward legislative proposals.</p>
      <div class="insight">The plan set Europe on a path toward centralised AML/CFT supervision and highlighted the limitations of relying solely on national regimes. For multinational institutions this implied the likelihood of harmonised obligations, less divergence between member states, and closer scrutiny of how effective AML controls are in practice. By signalling that legislative proposals were coming within a year, the Commission gave firms only a short window to prepare for significant structural change in oversight.</div>

      <h3>FinCEN Advisory FIN‑2020‑A002 on COVID‑19 medical scams (18 May)</h3>
      <p>FinCEN warned of fraud schemes involving counterfeit or non‑delivery of PPE/medical goods, price‑gouging, and business‑email compromise targeting emergency procurement; it listed SAR keywords and red‑flag indicators.</p>
      <div class="insight">The advisory provided compliance teams with practical guidance they could operationalise immediately. By issuing specific red flags and SAR keywords, FinCEN effectively created a typology catalogue for investigators, enabling them to adjust transaction‑monitoring rules and case narratives without delay. It also reinforced the expectation that firms must adapt quickly to novel threats, embedding pandemic‑related typologies into existing systems rather than waiting for new tools or processes to emerge.</div>

      <h3>Supervisors emphasise AML continuity during lockdowns</h3>
      <p>EU/UK and other regulators reiterated that AML/CFT obligations remain fully in force despite remote operations, urging risk‑based flexibility (e.g., alternative CDD) while maintaining monitoring and timely SARs.</p>
      <div class="insight">The repeated reminders from supervisors showed that regulatory expectations did not soften during the crisis. Institutions were expected to keep filing SARs on time, maintain ongoing monitoring, and ensure KYC standards were met even with staff working remotely. This required rapid contingency planning, the adaptation of digital onboarding tools, and investment in secure communications so compliance processes could function without interruption.</div>

      <h2>CFT — Counter‑Terrorism Financing</h2>
      <h3>Sanctions list maintenance and TF vigilance (May updates)</h3>
      <p>UN and national authorities issued routine updates to terrorism sanctions listings and aliases, requiring prompt screening refreshes and outreach where exposure existed.</p>
      <div class="insight">The May updates highlighted the operational challenge of keeping sanctions screening current in the middle of a global disruption. Institutions had to ensure their systems ingested new lists immediately and reconciled results across multiple vendors and platforms. For compliance officers, this underlined the importance of automation and robust quality checks, since even a short delay could expose firms to sanctions breaches.</div>

      <h3>Pandemic‑linked TF narratives</h3>
      <p>Authorities noted extremist groups attempting to exploit charity drives and online campaigns tied to COVID‑19 relief to solicit funds or launder proceeds.</p>
      <div class="insight">The pandemic created opportunities for extremist groups to disguise financing activity under the banner of humanitarian relief. Regulators and FIUs warned that donations flowing through new charities, informal value transfer systems, or online platforms might appear legitimate but could conceal terrorist financing. This demanded sharper due diligence on the purpose of funds, particularly cross‑border transfers and rapid‑growth charities that emerged suddenly during the crisis.</div>

      <h2>Fraud &amp; Financial Crime — Cases &amp; Trends</h2>
      <h3>Early prosecutions of stimulus/relief fraud (May)</h3>
      <p>Law enforcement announced initial cases alleging false statements and identity misuse to obtain pandemic relief funds, with misuse of mules and rapid movement of proceeds through personal accounts.</p>
      <div class="insight">These first prosecutions provided early warning of typologies that would soon become widespread. Fraudsters quickly exploited the speed of stimulus programs, creating false identities, using stolen data, and moving funds through accounts that had no history of business activity. Financial institutions could use these cases to back‑test past transactions and tune monitoring rules to detect similar attempts before losses multiplied.</div>

      <h3>PPE non‑delivery &amp; advance‑fee schemes persist</h3>
      <p>Following March–April spikes, May saw continued attempts to sell scarce PPE with upfront payments and no delivery, often via newly formed shell entities and fresh trade corridors.</p>
      <div class="insight">These scams underscored the importance of robust supplier due diligence and transactional safeguards such as escrow or letters of credit. Fraudsters exploited the urgency of medical demand by creating new shell companies, often with little operating history, and requesting large prepayments. Banks and buyers alike had to scrutinise counterparties more carefully, particularly when dealing with new jurisdictions and untested supply chains.</div>

      <h3>Business Email Compromise (BEC) targets emergency procurement</h3>
      <p>Attackers impersonated health agencies and suppliers to reroute payments for medical goods; invoice detail changes and domain look‑alikes were common.</p>
      <div class="insight">BEC attacks took advantage of the urgency surrounding health procurement, tricking staff into authorising changes to payment details. Fraudsters registered domain names closely resembling legitimate suppliers and sent urgent messages demanding immediate transfers. These cases highlighted the need for multi‑factor verification of bank detail changes, especially when large medical or government contracts were involved.</div>
