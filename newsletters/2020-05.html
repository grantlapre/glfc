    <section>
      <p>This issue captures key developments across Anti‑Money Laundering (AML), Counter‑Financing of Terrorism (CFT), and Fraud & Financial Crime as at 30 April 2020.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>AML — Regulatory &amp; Policy Developments</h2>
      <h3>European Commission — Public consultation for the AML/CFT Action Plan</h3>
      <p>In April, the Commission opened consultation on an EU‑level AML authority, a single rulebook, and strengthened FIU coordination — the groundwork for the Action Plan unveiled in early May.</p>
      <div class="insight">The consultation marked a decisive shift from patchwork national approaches toward a genuinely integrated system. By inviting feedback on central supervision and a single rulebook, Brussels signalled an appetite to standardise expectations on customer due diligence, beneficial‑ownership transparency, and risk‑based supervision. Institutions operating in multiple EU states could anticipate fewer grey areas, tighter supervisory cooperation, and an acceleration of cross‑border information‑sharing frameworks that would reshape group‑level AML policies.</div>

      <h3>FinCEN — COVID‑19 related guidance and SAR reminders</h3>
      <p>FinCEN issued notices encouraging vigilance on pandemic‑related fraud, priority SAR filing on COVID‑19 schemes, and flexible implementation of certain BSA obligations where appropriate.</p>
      <div class="insight">Beyond reiterating core BSA duties, FinCEN’s messaging acted as a playbook for immediate operationalisation. By specifying typologies and SAR keywords, it enabled rapid recalibration of monitoring scenarios, case narratives, and escalation paths so alerts captured PPE non‑delivery, price‑gouging, and emergency‑procurement BEC. The guidance also framed practical relief around documentation and timing without diluting expectations that institutions proactively detect and report novel pandemic abuses.</div>

      <h3>AUSTRAC — Supervision and enforcement focus signals</h3>
      <p>AUSTRAC highlighted targeted reviews across gambling and remittance sectors, noting heightened ML/TF vulnerabilities during the pandemic.</p>
      <div class="insight">The focus areas reflected risk migration as physical venues closed and digital volumes surged. Remitters faced liquidity pressures, altered send/receive patterns, and rising fraud attempts; gambling operators saw abrupt shifts to online channels and new onboarding spikes. AUSTRAC’s stance pushed firms to refresh business‑wide risk assessments, scrutinise third‑party arrangements, and harden transaction‑monitoring thresholds tailored to pandemic‑era behaviours.</div>

      <h2>CFT — Counter‑Terrorism Financing</h2>
      <h3>UN Security Council — ISIL (Da’esh) &amp; Al‑Qaida list updates</h3>
      <p>UN listings and amendments in April required rapid sanctions‑screening updates and outreach to counterparties where exposure existed.</p>
      <div class="insight">Frequent amendments during a period of operational stress tested the resilience of sanctions‑screening pipelines. Effective programs ingested changes automatically, reconciled differences across vendors, and verified true matches quickly to avoid payment delays. Firms also needed clear communication channels to counterparties to remediate exposures, demonstrating governance over data quality and exception handling.</div>

      <h3>Pandemic‑related TF alerts</h3>
      <p>FATF and regional bodies noted the potential exploitation of relief funds, charity fraud, and informal value transfer networks by extremist actors.</p>
      <div class="insight">Crisis‑era fundraising narratives blurred lines between legitimate aid and abuse. Institutions were expected to interrogate the purpose of funds, beneficiary legitimacy, sudden spikes in cross‑border donations, and the use of cash‑intensive or informal channels. Enhanced due diligence on emergent charities and tighter monitoring of online collections helped distinguish genuine relief from covert TF activity.</div>

      <h2>Fraud &amp; Financial Crime — Cases &amp; Trends</h2>
      <h3>Stimulus &amp; emergency‑relief fraud emerges</h3>
      <p>Authorities reported fraudulent claims against government relief schemes, phishing targeting stimulus payments, and mule activity through personal accounts.</p>
      <div class="insight">The speed and scale of relief programs created fertile ground for false identities, synthetic profiles, and account takeovers. Criminal groups rapidly tested lender portals and government systems, then laundered proceeds through newly opened accounts or previously dormant profiles. Banks benefited from back‑testing loan flows, tightening device/IP analytics, and deploying mule‑account interdiction playbooks aligned to public‑sector disbursement cycles.</div>

      <h3>PPE &amp; medical goods fraud surges</h3>
      <p>Following March’s Operation Pangea, April saw continued seizures of counterfeit masks and medicines, plus advance‑fee scams promising bulk PPE.</p>
      <div class="insight">Fraudsters pivoted to medical supply chains, leveraging shell entities, unverifiable certifications, and high‑pressure sales tied to scarcity. Effective controls combined supplier due diligence, escrow or letters of credit for first‑time counterparties, trade‑finance red‑flags, and shipping/document checks to validate provenance before releasing funds.</div>

      <h3>Market abuse vigilance</h3>
      <p>Securities regulators in the U.S. and EU warned about insider trading and manipulation risks amid elevated volatility and remote working.</p>
      <div class="insight">Market surveillance had to adapt to atypical trading patterns, dispersed teams, and increased use of personal devices. Firms revisited wall‑crossing procedures, tightened access controls on material non‑public information, and stress‑tested alerting thresholds to capture abusive strategies masked by pandemic‑driven volatility.</div>
