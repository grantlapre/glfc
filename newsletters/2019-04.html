      <p>This issue captures key developments across Anti‑Money Laundering (AML), Counter‑Financing of Terrorism (CFT), and Fraud & Financial Crime as at 31 March 2019.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>AML — Regulatory &amp; Policy Developments</h2>
      <h3>EU 5AMLD: from transposition to supervisory follow‑through</h3>
      <p>With the January deadline passed, Member States moved into the enforcement phase—clarifying expectations for virtual‑asset service providers, prepaid instruments, enhanced due diligence and access to beneficial‑ownership registers.</p>
      <div class="insight">Cross‑border groups standardised KYC to the strictest national baseline, embedded registry look‑ups into onboarding and reviews, and documented how ownership data influenced risk ratings and SAR narratives. Programs also tightened oversight of distributors and agents where onboarding occurred outside traditional branches.</div>

      <h3>6AMLD preparation gains pace</h3>
      <p>Firms began gap‑analysis for 6AMLD’s expanded predicate offences, aiding/abetting liability and harmonised penalties ahead of 2020 transposition.</p>
      <div class="insight">Compliance, investigations, and legal teams aligned on case‑handling playbooks, escalation thresholds, and record‑keeping standards. Training pipelines prioritised serious‑crime typologies and the evidentiary trail investigators must maintain for potential prosecution.</div>

      <h3>Virtual‑asset compliance: expectations crystallise</h3>
      <p>Supervisors signalled heightened expectations for AML controls at exchanges, custodial wallets and payment intermediaries following FATF’s late‑2018 updates.</p>
      <div class="insight">Banks mapped exposure to crypto‑native businesses and payment processors, defined EDD triggers, and reviewed correspondent/payment‑rail relationships to prevent risk obfuscation in aggregate flows. Monitoring teams added red flags for exchange‑to‑exchange movements, mixers and rapid in/out cashing patterns.</div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>CFT — Counter‑Terrorism Financing</h2>
      <h3>Sanctions maintenance across UN/EU/US regimes</h3>
      <p>Routine listings and amendments in March targeted ISIL/Al‑Qaida affiliates and regional facilitators.</p>
      <div class="insight">Institutions tightened daily ingestion cadences and verified propagation of list updates across customer, payment and trade‑finance screening. First‑line teams rehearsed pause‑and‑review and strengthened documentation quality so alert decisions were audit‑ready.</div>

      <h3>NPO flows and small‑value payment vigilance</h3>
      <p>Authorities reiterated risks around small, recurring donations routed via online platforms and informal value transfer channels.</p>
      <div class="insight">Monitoring scenarios were tuned to detect aggregation across linked accounts and channels, with analysts trained to recognise narratives indicative of abuse. SARs emphasised context—beneficiary links, geography and transaction purpose—to preserve investigative value for FIUs.</div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Fraud &amp; Financial Crime — Cases &amp; Trends</h2>
      <h3>Tax‑season phishing and BEC intensify</h3>
      <p>March saw sustained phishing and business‑email compromise activity exploiting payroll and invoice workflows.</p>
      <div class="insight">Fraud teams implemented call‑back verification for changes to supplier bank details, applied velocity limits to first‑time beneficiaries, and expanded customer education. Security telemetry (anomalous logins, MFA prompts) was integrated with payment controls to intercept transfers before settlement.</div>

      <h3>Account‑takeover risk remains elevated</h3>
      <p>Credential dumps and password reuse continued to drive account‑takeover attempts across financial platforms.</p>
      <div class="insight">Banks deployed device fingerprinting and IP reputation scoring, enforced step‑up authentication on anomalous events, and launched proactive password‑reset campaigns for exposed cohorts to reduce downstream fraud.</div>

      <h3>Trade‑based money laundering vigilance</h3>
      <p>Authorities and industry groups highlighted TBML typologies involving over/under‑invoicing, phantom shipments and high‑risk commodities.</p>
      <div class="insight">Institutions strengthened collaboration between trade‑finance operations and AML investigations, cross‑checking documents against shipment data and pricing benchmarks. Enhanced due diligence focused on intermediaries, dual‑use goods and sudden trade pattern shifts.</div>
