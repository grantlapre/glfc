      <h3>AML Risks Associated with Gold</h3>
      <p class="deck">Gold‚Äôs liquidity and value‚Äëdensity make it a perennial laundering vehicle; supply‚Äëchain controls are essential.</p>
      <p>The global <strong>gold trade</strong> remains highly attractive to money launderers because of its liquidity, high value‚Äëto‚Äëweight ratio, and ease of cross‚Äëborder movement. Criminal groups exploit the gold sector at multiple stages: theft, purchase of unrefined ore, investment in mines, smelting, refining, and wholesale resale. A common typology involves criminals using illicit cash to purchase refined gold, which is then sold through shell or front companies‚Äîoften at discounted prices‚Äîto disguise origins. The proceeds re‚Äëenter the financial system appearing legitimate. Cash‚Äëintensive wholesalers further complicate oversight by mingling illicit flows with lawful sales. Regulators are increasingly aware: in Australia, proposed <strong>‚ÄúTranche Two‚Äù</strong> AML/CTF reforms would bring <strong>high value dealers</strong> (jewelers, precious‚Äëstone traders, real estate, art dealers) under AUSTRAC obligations. These businesses would need to perform CDD, report suspicious transactions, and maintain compliance programs to close long‚Äëstanding regulatory gaps.</p>

      <h3>Miami Gold Dealers Sentenced in $3.6 Billion Scheme</h3>
      <p class="deck">Former NTR Metals executives sentenced for laundering illicit gold flows from Latin America through Miami.</p>
      <p>In early 2018, <strong>U.S. District Judge Robert Scola</strong> sentenced former NTR Metals executives <strong>Samer Barrage</strong> and <strong>Juan Granda</strong> for their roles in a massive gold‚Äëbased money‚Äëlaundering conspiracy. Operating out of <strong>Doral, Florida</strong>, they admitted importing tons of illicitly sourced gold from Latin America between 2012 and 2016, channeling more than <strong>$3.6 billion</strong> through the U.S. precious‚Äëmetals sector. The scheme laundered proceeds of drug trafficking and organized crime, exploiting weak due diligence in the gold supply chain. Barrage received nearly seven years in prison, while Granda was sentenced to six years, reduced for cooperation. Prosecutors credited both for assisting in ongoing investigations and partially repaying illicit profits. The case highlighted systemic vulnerabilities in U.S. precious‚Äëmetals imports, where shell suppliers and falsified paperwork obscured the true origin of gold. For AML officers, it underscored the need for enhanced supply‚Äëchain scrutiny and tighter trade‚Äëfinance controls.</p>

      <h3>FATF January 2018 Public Statement & Compliance List</h3>
      <p class="deck">North Korea & Iran remain highest risk; Bosnia & Herzegovina exits monitoring; several jurisdictions stay under scrutiny.</p>
      <p>On <strong>19 January 2018</strong>, the <strong>Financial Action Task Force (FATF)</strong> published its updated public statement on high‚Äërisk and monitored jurisdictions. <strong>North Korea</strong> and <strong>Iran</strong> remained under the highest level of countermeasure guidance, with FATF urging global institutions to apply enhanced due diligence and, where required, countermeasures. At the same time, <strong>Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina</strong> was removed from the list following substantial AML/CFT progress, while <strong>Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Syria, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, Tunisia, and Yemen</strong> remained under increased monitoring. For compliance teams, the announcement triggered immediate updates to country‚Äërisk matrices, sanctions‚Äëscreening systems, and due‚Äëdiligence frameworks. Institutions with correspondent relationships or remittance corridors in affected regions should test controls for cross‚Äëborder wires and trade finance, ensuring high‚Äërisk exposure is identified and escalated promptly.</p>

      <h3>Danske Bank Estonia Case Prompts Danish FSA Review</h3>
      <p class="deck">Regulator orders an external review after concerns on non‚Äëresident flows through the Estonian branch.</p>
      <p>On <strong>23 January 2018</strong>, the <strong>Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA)</strong> ordered <strong>Danske Bank</strong> to conduct an external review of its AML controls following concerns over non‚Äëresident flows through its Estonian branch. The unit‚Äîlater revealed to have processed around <strong>‚Ç¨200&nbsp;billion</strong> of suspicious transactions between 2007 and 2015‚Äîwas already under scrutiny by local regulators and investigative journalists. The FSA‚Äôs intervention required Danske to strengthen governance, improve monitoring of cross‚Äëborder transactions, and assess whether internal escalation channels were effective. The move foreshadowed one of Europe‚Äôs largest laundering scandals, drawing attention to Nordic banks‚Äô exposure to high‚Äërisk client portfolios in the Baltics. For AML officers, this was an early signal of supervisory expectations for group‚Äëlevel oversight and strong head‚Äëoffice/branch compliance coordination.</p>

      <h3>FinCEN Moves Against Latvia‚Äôs ABLV Bank (Section 311)</h3>
      <p class="deck">Designation as a ‚Äúprimary money laundering concern‚Äù isolates ABLV from the U.S. financial system.</p>
      <p>On <strong>23 January 2018</strong>, the <strong>U.S. Treasury‚Äôs FinCEN</strong> designated <strong>ABLV Bank</strong>, one of Latvia‚Äôs largest lenders, as a ‚Äúprimary money laundering concern‚Äù under <strong>Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act</strong>. The finding accused ABLV of institutionalised corruption, facilitating transactions for North Korea‚Äôs procurement networks, and allowing high‚Äërisk clients to launder billions. The designation effectively cut the bank off from the U.S. financial system and triggered immediate liquidity stress, forcing Latvia‚Äôs central bank to step in. The case illustrated how a Section 311 action can serve as a de‚Äëfacto ‚Äúdeath sentence‚Äù for a financial institution, highlighting the extra‚Äëterritorial impact of U.S. measures. For compliance officers, the ABLV case reinforced the importance of monitoring correspondent relationships, reviewing exposure to Baltic institutions, and stress‚Äëtesting contingency plans in the event of sanctions or 311 findings.</p>

      <h3>Azerbaijani Laundromat ‚Äî New Revelations</h3>
      <p class="deck">OCCRP/Guardian link more European figures to a $2.9bn slush‚Äëfund network using shells and Baltic banks.</p>
      <p>In <strong>January 2018</strong>, investigative outlets including <strong>OCCRP</strong> and the <strong>Guardian</strong> published further findings into the <strong>‚ÄúAzerbaijani Laundromat‚Äù</strong>, a complex $2.9 billion slush fund and laundering scheme. New reports linked additional European politicians, lobbyists, and firms to suspicious payments routed through shell companies in the UK and Denmark between 2012 and 2014. The revelations pointed to continued misuse of Baltic banks and highlighted systemic gaps in monitoring politically exposed persons (PEPs) and trade‚Äëfinance structures. For compliance teams, the follow‚Äëup underscored the reputational risks of indirect exposure through correspondent banking or professional intermediaries. It also emphasized the importance of adverse‚Äëmedia screening, beneficial‚Äëownership mapping, and documenting the rationale for maintaining higher‚Äërisk client relationships, particularly in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus.</p>

      <h3>U.S. Treasury Flags Beneficial‚ÄëOwnership Gaps</h3>
      <p class="deck">Report urges a federal framework to capture ultimate owners at company formation.</p>
      <p>In <strong>January 2018</strong>, the <strong>U.S. Department of the Treasury</strong> delivered a congressionally mandated report highlighting deficiencies in <strong>beneficial ownership transparency</strong>. The report identified the lack of a federal requirement to collect beneficial‚Äëowner information at company incorporation as a significant vulnerability exploited by money launderers and kleptocrats. Treasury recommended legislative action to create a national beneficial‚Äëownership registry, arguing that state‚Äëlevel incorporation systems left U.S. shell companies open to abuse. For AML compliance teams, the report supported strengthening customer due diligence and raised expectations that Congress might soon pass corporate‚Äëtransparency legislation. Institutions were encouraged to document beneficial‚Äëownership collection practices carefully and ensure consistency in identifying and verifying UBOs for higher‚Äërisk legal‚Äëentity clients.</p>

      <h3>Israel Becomes a Full FATF Member</h3>
      <p class="deck">From 1 Jan 2018, Israel sits at the FATF table‚Äîraising cooperation and evaluation expectations.</p>
      <p>On <strong>1 January 2018</strong>, <strong>Israel</strong> was admitted as the <strong>38th full member</strong> of the <strong>Financial Action Task Force (FATF)</strong>. The decision followed years of reforms in Israel‚Äôs financial system and efforts to enhance counter‚Äëterrorist financing measures. Membership places Israel on an equal footing with other leading economies in shaping global AML/CFT standards and commits it to regular mutual evaluations. For regional compliance teams, Israel‚Äôs membership strengthened cooperation with European and North American partners, increasing expectations for consistent application of FATF recommendations. It also signaled that jurisdictions in the Middle East could achieve full integration into the FATF network if reforms are implemented effectively. Compliance officers should monitor how Israel‚Äôs supervision and enforcement frameworks evolve, particularly regarding financial institutions serving high‚Äërisk sectors such as fintech and cross‚Äëborder payments.</p>

      <h3>Early Warnings ‚Äî Punjab National Bank Fraud</h3>
      <p class="deck">Irregularities in LoUs emerge ahead of a scandal that would soon exceed $1.7bn.</p>
      <p>In <strong>January 2018</strong>, red flags began to surface around fraudulent transactions at <strong>Punjab National Bank (PNB)</strong> in India, later revealed to involve more than <strong>$1.7&nbsp;billion</strong>. Investigators identified misuse of <strong>letters of undertaking (LoUs)</strong> issued by rogue employees, enabling companies linked to jeweler <strong>Nirav Modi</strong> to obtain credit overseas. Though the scandal broke publicly in February, January saw early reports of irregularities in PNB‚Äôs trade‚Äëfinance operations. The fraud exposed weaknesses in internal controls, SWIFT messaging oversight, and reconciliation of contingent liabilities. For AML officers, the case highlighted vulnerabilities in trade‚Äëfinance processes, especially where manual intervention allows circumvention of core banking systems. Institutions with trade‚Äëfinance exposure to Indian counterparties should test LoU‚Äërelated controls and enhance monitoring for anomalies in guarantees and credit instruments.</p>
