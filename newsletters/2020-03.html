      <p>This issue captures key developments across Anti‑Money Laundering (AML), Counter‑Financing of Terrorism (CFT), and Fraud & Financial Crime as at 29 February 2020.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>AML — Regulatory &amp; Policy Developments</h2>
      <h3>U.S. Treasury — 2020 National Illicit Finance Strategy (6 Feb 2020)</h3>
      <p>Treasury released a refreshed strategy to modernise the U.S. AML/CFT regime, prioritising beneficial‑ownership transparency, efficiency, innovation, and stronger public‑private partnerships.</p>
      <div class="insight">The strategy signalled that supervisors would increasingly judge programs by outcomes rather than process volume. Compliance leaders began mapping how a central beneficial‑ownership framework could streamline KYC while raising expectations for data quality and validation. It also encouraged deeper collaboration with law enforcement and use of regtech—analytics, automation, and improved feedback loops—to increase the investigative value of SARs.</div>

      <h3>FATF Plenary Outcomes (19–21 Feb 2020)</h3>
      <p>FATF reaffirmed Iran as a high‑risk jurisdiction subject to countermeasures and kept Pakistan under increased monitoring pending further action on its 27‑point plan.</p>
      <div class="insight">These outcomes had immediate implications for risk‑scoring, correspondent banking exposure, and EDD triggers. Institutions reviewed list‑ingestion processes, recalibrated screening thresholds for high‑risk corridors, and refreshed customer outreach where activity intersected with Iranian exposure or Pakistan‑related gaps.</div>

      <h3>UK Economic Crime Plan 2019–22 — February progress items</h3>
      <p>UK authorities signalled ongoing supervision enhancements and information‑sharing initiatives under the Economic Crime Plan.</p>
      <div class="insight">For firms, this pointed to tighter expectations around effectiveness, not just policy completeness. It also foreshadowed stronger intelligence partnerships (e.g., public‑private sharing forums) and renewed focus on beneficial‑ownership accuracy—nudging institutions to invest in data controls and MI that evidence real‑world impact.</div>

    <section>
      <h2>CFT — Counter‑Terrorism Financing</h2>
      <h3>FATF Plenary focus on TF risk</h3>
      <p>Outcomes emphasised continued pressure on Iran‑linked TF risks and monitoring of Pakistan’s action‑plan completion, with implications for correspondent banking and EDD across high‑risk corridors.</p>
      <div class="insight">The emphasis on TF resilience underscored that sanctions controls and AML monitoring must operate as a single system. Banks revisited wire‑payment rules for higher‑risk corridors, ensured watchlist updates were propagated promptly, and enhanced narrative capture in SARs so FIUs could follow cross‑border linkages more effectively.</div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Fraud &amp; Financial Crime — Enforcement &amp; Cases</h2>
      <h3>Context watch</h3>
      <p>No major new global fraud/corruption resolutions were finalised in February that materially shifted risk exposure. Institutions should continue to monitor Baltic/Nordic probes and AUSTRAC‑driven effectiveness expectations in Australia.</p>
      <div class="insight">The absence of large February resolutions did not imply reduced risk. Ongoing European investigations into legacy Baltic/Nordic flows and AUSTRAC’s assertive stance in Australia kept pressure on boards to evidence control effectiveness. Firms used the window to strengthen model‑risk governance, tune alerting on cross‑border flows, and document escalation pathways for issues emerging from affiliate reviews.</div>
