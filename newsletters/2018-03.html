      <h3>Digital Currency Exchanges to be Regulated in Australia</h3>
      <p class="deck">From 3 Apr 2018, DCEs come under the AML/CTF Act: registration with AUSTRAC, CDD, reporting, and record‚Äëkeeping.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>From <strong>3 April 2018</strong>, <strong>Digital Currency Exchange (DCE)</strong> service providers became subject to Australia‚Äôs <strong>AML/CTF Act</strong> following passage of the <strong>AML/CTF Amendment Act 2017</strong>. This reform addressed growing financial‚Äëcrime risks in the crypto‚Äëasset sector. DCEs must <strong>register with AUSTRAC</strong>, conduct <strong>customer identification and verification</strong>, adopt written AML/CTF programs, file <strong>suspicious matter reports</strong> and <strong>threshold transaction reports</strong> (cash ‚â• AUD 10,000), and maintain records for seven years. Police clearances are mandated for key personnel. At the time, numerous Australian exchanges (ACX, BTC Markets, CoinJar, CoinTree) and international players serving Australian clients (Coinbase, TransferWise, OFX) prepared compliance frameworks rapidly. For AML officers, this marked a shift from voluntary measures to enforceable obligations, placing Australia among early jurisdictions to regulate digital currencies formally under AML law.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>On <strong>20 December 2017</strong>, the <strong>European Parliament and Council</strong> reached agreement on the <strong>5th Anti‚ÄëMoney Laundering Directive (5AMLD)</strong>, a major step in the EU‚Äôs fight against financial crime. 5AMLD requires greater public access to <strong>beneficial ownership registers</strong>, extends the powers of <strong>Financial Intelligence Units</strong>, and imposes stricter safeguards for transactions linked to <strong>high‚Äërisk countries</strong>. It also targets emerging risks by bringing <strong>virtual currency exchanges</strong> and <strong>custodian wallet providers</strong> into scope and lowering identification thresholds for <strong>anonymous prepaid cards</strong>. Implementation timelines set for 2019 required member states to transpose provisions into national law. For AML compliance officers, 5AMLD highlighted the urgency of updating CDD processes, expanding oversight of VASPs, and monitoring cross‚Äëborder flows linked to high‚Äërisk jurisdictions.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>At its <strong>21‚Äì23 February 2018</strong> plenary in Paris, the <strong>Financial Action Task Force (FATF)</strong> reaffirmed that <strong>North Korea and Iran</strong> remain subject to the highest levels of countermeasures and called on members to apply enhanced due diligence. FATF also continued monitoring of jurisdictions such as Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Syria, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, Tunisia, and Yemen, while acknowledging progress in some cases. The meeting emphasized emerging terrorist financing risks, improvements in beneficial ownership frameworks, and sectoral guidance. For AML teams, the plenary meant immediate updates to risk assessments and screening lists. Firms were advised to check customer exposure to high‚Äërisk jurisdictions and enhance correspondent‚Äëbanking controls, while tracking forthcoming FATF work on virtual assets.</p>

      <h3>Punjab National Bank Fraud Exposed</h3>
      <p class="deck">PNB discloses >$1.7bn LoU fraud tied to Nirav Modi/Mehul Choksi; serious control gaps in trade finance and SWIFT use.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>On <strong>14 February 2018</strong>, <strong>Punjab National Bank (PNB)</strong> disclosed a massive fraud involving unauthorized <strong>letters of undertaking (LoUs)</strong>, later estimated at over <strong>$1.7 billion</strong>. Rogue staff allegedly issued LoUs via SWIFT, enabling companies linked to jeweler <strong>Nirav Modi</strong> and <strong>Mehul Choksi</strong> to obtain overseas credit. The fraud bypassed PNB‚Äôs core banking system, exposing serious internal control gaps. Indian authorities opened investigations, while international confirming banks faced questions on reliance on PNB guarantees. For AML professionals, the scandal highlights vulnerabilities in trade finance, especially when manual processes circumvent automated monitoring. Programs should stress‚Äëtest LoU controls, ensure segregation of duties in SWIFT operations, and reinforce scrutiny on high‚Äëvalue clients in sectors vulnerable to corruption and fraud.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>On <strong>15 February 2018</strong>, the <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong> announced a <strong>deferred prosecution agreement (DPA)</strong> with <strong>U.S. Bank N.A.</strong> for willful BSA/AML violations. The bank admitted capping the number of transaction‚Äëmonitoring alerts its systems could generate, leading to missed suspicious activity reports (SARs). It agreed to forfeit <strong>$528 million</strong>, while parallel actions imposed penalties of $185m (FinCEN), $75m (OCC), and $15m (Federal Reserve). Regulators highlighted failures to staff compliance adequately and to escalate issues transparently. For AML teams, the case reinforces the risks of resource constraints, poor model governance, and misaligned incentives. Alert thresholds must be based on risk, not convenience, and supervisors must be kept apprised of known gaps.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>On <strong>7 February 2018</strong>, <strong>Rabobank N.A.</strong>, a California subsidiary of the Dutch group, pleaded guilty to conspiring to obstruct the <strong>Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)</strong> by concealing AML deficiencies. The bank admitted to failures in monitoring high‚Äërisk transactions linked to Mexico‚Äëborder cash flows and MSBs, and to withholding information during OCC exams. The plea agreement required <strong>$368 million</strong> in forfeiture plus a $50m OCC penalty. U.S. prosecutors underscored the seriousness of misleading regulators, especially where cross‚Äëborder risks are high. For AML professionals, Rabobank illustrates the importance of candid regulatory engagement, robust monitoring of geographic risks, and governance around correspondent and MSB relationships.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>On <strong>23 February 2018</strong>, the <strong>U.S. Treasury</strong> announced what it called the ‚Äúlargest ever‚Äù sanctions package against <strong>North Korea</strong>, targeting 27 shipping companies and 28 vessels involved in evasion schemes. In parallel, Treasury, State, and the U.S. Coast Guard issued a <strong>maritime advisory</strong> outlining deceptive practices such as ship‚Äëto‚Äëship transfers, flag‚Äëhopping, and disabling AIS trackers. The measures sought to curb DPRK‚Äôs ability to fund its nuclear program through illicit maritime trade. For compliance teams, the package underscored the need to expand sanctions‚Äëscreening to vessel identifiers, monitor trade‚Äëfinance transactions for hidden links to shipping, and incorporate maritime risk into AML frameworks. Institutions supporting global shipping and commodities trade should scrutinize vessel ownership and counterparties more closely.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>On <strong>28 February 2018</strong>, UK authorities confirmed the first use of <strong>Unexplained Wealth Orders (UWOs)</strong>, introduced by the <strong>Criminal Finances Act 2017</strong>. The orders target assets suspected to have been acquired with illicit funds, requiring owners to explain the source of wealth. While details of the individuals involved were not disclosed, the National Crime Agency signalled UWOs would focus on politically exposed persons (PEPs) and individuals linked to serious crime. For financial institutions, UWOs highlight regulators‚Äô increasing reliance on asset‚Äëbased measures to disrupt illicit finance. AML officers should prepare for more frequent source‚Äëof‚Äëwealth queries, ensure high‚Äëvalue customer files are up to date, and consider reputational‚Äërisk assessments for clients in corruption‚Äëprone sectors.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>On <strong>1 February 2018</strong>, Swiss regulator <strong>FINMA</strong> announced enforcement against <strong>Gazprombank Switzerland</strong> for serious AML breaches between 2006 and 2016. The bank was barred from taking on new private clients until controls were strengthened. Failures included inadequate due diligence on higher‚Äërisk clients and weak suspicious‚Äëtransaction reporting. In a parallel case, FINMA concluded proceedings against <strong>PKB Privatbank</strong> for similar lapses in monitoring and KYC. Both cases illustrated persistent weaknesses in private‚Äëbanking controls, particularly with complex structures and clients from high‚Äërisk geographies. For compliance teams, the sanctions underscore FINMA‚Äôs intolerance of sustained deficiencies and willingness to impose business restrictions. Private‚Äëbanking programs should review PEP onboarding, monitoring thresholds, and escalation procedures.</p>

        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>On <strong>18 February 2018</strong>, Latvia‚Äôs anti‚Äëcorruption bureau detained <strong>IlmƒÅrs Rim≈°ƒìviƒçs</strong>, the governor of the central bank and member of the <strong>ECB Governing Council</strong>, on bribery allegations. The arrest came amid turmoil surrounding <strong>ABLV Bank</strong>, which had been hit by a U.S. FinCEN 311 action days earlier. Though separate cases, the developments raised concerns about governance, political integrity, and AML oversight in Latvia‚Äôs financial system. The ECB confirmed Rim≈°ƒìviƒçs could not participate in monetary policy decisions while under investigation. For compliance officers, the episode highlighted how governance and AML concerns can intersect, particularly in smaller jurisdictions exposed to non‚Äëresident flows. Institutions with Baltic exposure should reassess reputational risk and country‚Äërisk assumptions.</p>
