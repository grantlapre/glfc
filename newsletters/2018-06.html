      <h3>Challenges with Screening Lists</h3>
      <p class="deck">False positives, data quality and outdated lists strain AML screening; AI/ML and better governance can help.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>Financial institutions continue to struggle with the efficiency and effectiveness of their sanctions and PEP screening systems. In recent years, U.S. regulators have imposed over <strong>USD 15&nbsp;billion</strong> in fines for sanctions‚Äërelated violations, while global compliance costs have surpassed <strong>USD 280&nbsp;billion</strong>. Yet, studies show that more than <strong>90% of alerts</strong> generated are false positives, consuming resources and delaying investigations. Institutions often face challenges such as duplicate or inconsistent customer records, over‚Äëreliance on a single vendor, and outdated or inflexible lists. Screening must encompass a wide range of sources: <strong>UN Sanctions, OFAC SDN, UK HMT, EU, Canadian OSFI, Australian lists, U.S. BIS</strong>, and <strong>State Department non‚Äëproliferation lists</strong>. Increasingly, firms are exploring artificial intelligence and machine learning to reduce noise and focus on high‚Äëvalue alerts. For AML compliance officers, improving data quality, governance, and system tuning is critical to balancing effectiveness with efficiency.</p>

      <h3>SEC Charges Broker‚ÄëDealers & CCO for AML Failures</h3>
      <p class="deck">Chardan & ICBCFS cited for not filing SARs on penny stocks; CCO barred and fined.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>On <strong>16 May 2018</strong>, the <strong>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</strong> announced enforcement actions against <strong>Chardan Capital Markets LLC</strong> and <strong>Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Financial Services (ICBCFS)</strong> for failing to file suspicious activity reports on penny stock transactions. The firms cleared and executed trades in low‚Äëpriced securities that bore multiple red flags, yet no SARs were filed. The SEC also sanctioned <strong>Jerard Basmagy</strong>, the Chief Compliance Officer and AML officer of Chardan, for ‚Äúwillfully aiding and abetting‚Äù violations. Basmagy agreed to a <strong>USD 15,000 penalty</strong> and a <strong>three‚Äëyear industry bar</strong>. The case underscores regulators‚Äô expectations that broker‚Äëdealers act as effective gatekeepers, ensuring AML programs identify and report unusual activity. For compliance officers, it reinforces the importance of independent oversight, escalation protocols, and a culture of accountability within both introducing and clearing firms.</p>

      <h3>U.S. Withdrawal from JCPOA & Wind‚Äëdowns</h3>
      <p class="deck">8 May: U.S. exits Iran deal; OFAC sets 90/180‚Äëday wind‚Äëdowns and snap‚Äëback of secondary sanctions.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>On <strong>8 May 2018</strong>, President Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the <strong>Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)</strong>. The <strong>U.S. Treasury‚Äôs OFAC</strong> immediately issued guidance establishing <strong>90‚Äëday and 180‚Äëday wind‚Äëdown periods</strong> for activities previously permitted. At the end of these periods, U.S. secondary sanctions targeting Iran‚Äôs energy, financial, shipping, and insurance sectors would snap back into place. OFAC also withdrew general licenses covering aircraft and automobile sales, among other sectors. For financial institutions, the return of broad secondary sanctions revived risk exposures across trade finance, correspondent banking, and insurance markets. Non‚ÄëU.S. banks with Iranian exposure faced a stark choice between continuing activity with Iran and preserving U.S. market access. Compliance officers were urged to review sanctions‚Äëscreening protocols, update risk assessments, and communicate proactively with clients about wind‚Äëdown obligations.</p>

      <h3>EU Council Formally Adopts 5AMLD</h3>
      <p class="deck">14 May: Council signs off on 5AMLD ‚Äî BO transparency, account registries, VASPs in scope.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>On <strong>14 May 2018</strong>, the <strong>Council of the European Union</strong> formally adopted the <strong>Fifth Anti‚ÄëMoney Laundering Directive (5AMLD)</strong>, completing the legislative process after Parliament‚Äôs April approval. 5AMLD requires member states to expand <strong>public access to beneficial ownership registers</strong>, establish <strong>centralised bank and payment account registries</strong>, and bring <strong>virtual‚Äëcurrency exchanges and custodian wallet providers</strong> into scope for AML obligations. It also reduces prepaid card thresholds, strengthens enhanced due diligence on high‚Äërisk countries, and improves cooperation between financial intelligence units (FIUs). The Directive entered into force in July 2018, with national transposition deadlines set for 2020. For AML compliance officers, 5AMLD provided a clear legislative mandate to review customer‚Äëdue‚Äëdiligence policies, adapt onboarding for crypto‚Äëasset exposures, and prepare for greater transparency around beneficial ownership.</p>

      <h3>UK SAMLA 2018 Receives Royal Assent</h3>
      <p class="deck">23 May: UK gains autonomous sanctions/AML powers; Overseas Territories BO transparency debated.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>On <strong>23 May 2018</strong>, the <strong>Sanctions and Anti‚ÄëMoney Laundering Act (SAMLA) 2018</strong> received <strong>Royal Assent</strong>, providing the UK with a domestic legal framework for sanctions and AML measures after Brexit. The Act enables ministers to impose autonomous UK sanctions, update AML regulations, and enhance information‚Äësharing powers. One of the most contentious elements was Parliament‚Äôs push for greater <strong>beneficial ownership transparency</strong> in the UK <strong>Overseas Territories</strong>, with MPs requiring public registers of company ownership by 2020. For firms, SAMLA represented a fundamental shift in sanctions compliance obligations: institutions had to anticipate divergence from EU listings and prepare for independent UK enforcement. For AML compliance officers, the Act highlighted the importance of horizon scanning and adapting group frameworks to cover parallel U.S., EU, and UK regimes.</p>

      <h3>SEC Halts Titanium Blockchain ICO</h3>
      <p class="deck">30 May: SEC freezes assets, appoints receiver, cites false partnership claims.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>On <strong>30 May 2018</strong>, the <strong>SEC</strong> obtained an emergency court order halting the <strong>Titanium Blockchain Infrastructure Services ICO</strong>, which had raised more than <strong>USD 21&nbsp;million</strong> from investors worldwide. The SEC alleged founder Michael Stollery engaged in fraud by making false claims about partnerships with major U.S. companies and government agencies. A receiver was appointed, assets were frozen, and civil charges filed. The case highlighted the regulator‚Äôs ongoing crackdown on fraudulent ICOs and the expectation that digital‚Äëasset promotions meet securities‚Äëlaw and AML obligations. For AML compliance teams, the enforcement underscored the risks of onboarding ICO issuers and investors without robust due diligence. It also reminded financial institutions of the importance of monitoring crypto‚Äërelated flows for potential fraud, sanctions violations, or unregistered securities activity.</p>

        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>On <strong>16‚Äì17 May 2018</strong>, the <strong>U.S. Treasury‚Äôs OFAC</strong> designated several senior <strong>Hezbollah</strong> leaders and facilitators, including financier <strong>Mohammad Bazzi</strong>, along with entities tied to Iran‚Äôs Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps‚ÄëQuds Force. The measures aimed to disrupt Hezbollah‚Äôs access to global financial networks and highlighted the group‚Äôs reliance on commercial activities in Lebanon and West Africa. These actions followed the re‚Äëimposition of Iran sanctions and were coordinated with partners in the <strong>Terrorist Financing Targeting Center (TFTC)</strong>. For financial institutions, the designations demanded immediate updates to sanctions‚Äëscreening tools, careful monitoring of correspondent relationships, and heightened attention to payments or trade finance involving Lebanon, West Africa, or sectors known for Hezbollah activity.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>In <strong>late May 2018</strong>, <strong>FinCEN</strong> extended its <strong>Geographic Targeting Orders (GTOs)</strong> requiring title insurers to report all‚Äëcash purchases of luxury residential real estate above certain thresholds in major U.S. metropolitan areas. The program, originally launched in 2016, aims to identify shell companies used to launder illicit funds through high‚Äëvalue property acquisitions. The renewal continued coverage of markets such as <strong>New York, Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Honolulu</strong>, with reporting thresholds ranging from USD 300,000 to USD 3 million. For compliance officers, the extension reinforced real estate as a high‚Äërisk sector for money laundering, particularly involving politically exposed persons (PEPs) and foreign beneficial owners. Institutions financing property transactions or interacting with title companies were reminded to incorporate real estate exposure into risk assessments.</p>

      <h3>EU Removes Two Jurisdictions from Tax Blacklist</h3>
      <p class="deck">25 May: Bahamas and St Kitts &amp; Nevis delisted after commitments to reforms.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>On <strong>25 May 2018</strong>, the <strong>Council of the EU</strong> announced the removal of <strong>The Bahamas</strong> and <strong>St Kitts &amp; Nevis</strong> from its list of non‚Äëcooperative tax jurisdictions, following commitments to improve tax transparency and implement reforms. The update left seven jurisdictions on the blacklist, with several others placed on the ‚Äúgrey list‚Äù for monitoring. While not formally an AML tool, the EU list is increasingly used by financial institutions as a complementary factor in <strong>customer risk assessments</strong> and <strong>enhanced due diligence</strong>. For AML compliance officers, the removal of these two jurisdictions provided some relief for correspondent banking and trade finance relationships but underscored the dynamic nature of tax‚Äëgood‚Äëgovernance risk. Monitoring such changes remains critical for updating internal country risk ratings and client due diligence policies.</p>
