      <p>This issue captures key developments across Anti‑Money Laundering (AML), Counter‑Financing of Terrorism (CFT), and Fraud & Financial Crime as at 30 June 2020.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>AML — Regulatory &amp; Policy Developments</h2>
      <h3>FATF Virtual Plenary (24 June 2020)</h3>
      <p>FATF held its first virtual Plenary, confirming continued monitoring of high-risk jurisdictions. Iceland and Mongolia were removed from the grey list, while Mauritius and Botswana remained under increased monitoring.</p>
      <div class="insight">The virtual Plenary proved that FATF could still deliver decisive outcomes during global disruption. For institutions, the removal of Iceland and Mongolia reduced compliance overheads, while the retention of other countries highlighted where enhanced due diligence had to continue. These moves reinforced the need for risk frameworks to adapt instantly to FATF list changes, since correspondent banking and customer onboarding policies are directly impacted.</div>

      <h3>European Banking Authority (EBA) AML Guidelines</h3>
      <p>The EBA issued guidelines on risk-based supervision for national authorities, encouraging consistency across member states.</p>
      <div class="insight">The guidelines signalled a stronger push for convergence in how AML risks are assessed and supervised across the EU. For firms, this translated into clearer expectations on governance, group-wide risk assessments, and how supervisors would evaluate effectiveness. It marked a move away from fragmented practices and toward a harmonised oversight culture that places greater pressure on large cross-border institutions.</div>

      <h3>FinCEN Advisory on Impersonation Scams &amp; Money Mule Schemes</h3>
      <p>FinCEN published red flags on scams where fraudsters impersonated government agencies or businesses to extract funds, often via mule accounts.</p>
      <div class="insight">The advisory highlighted how fraud and AML are increasingly interconnected. By calling out money mules explicitly, FinCEN pushed banks to integrate fraud detection and AML monitoring more closely. This meant breaking down silos between operational fraud teams and compliance staff so that intelligence could flow seamlessly into SARs and disrupt broader laundering networks.</div>

      <h2>CFT — Counter‑Terrorism Financing</h2>
      <h3>UN Security Council Sanctions Updates</h3>
      <p>The UN added new designations linked to ISIL and Al-Qaida affiliates, requiring immediate updates to screening systems.</p>
      <div class="insight">Even amid a pandemic, terrorist financing risks evolved through new aliases and entities. Institutions were challenged to ensure sanctions lists were ingested in real time and tested across all business lines. This highlighted the operational importance of automation, as manual list updates risked leaving exposure gaps at precisely the moment criminals sought to exploit them.</div>

      <h3>FATF on TF &amp; Proliferation Financing Risks</h3>
      <p>FATF released reports highlighting how COVID-19 disrupted supply chains while increasing vulnerabilities to proliferation financing.</p>
      <div class="insight">These findings expanded the risk horizon, reminding institutions that terrorist financing and proliferation risks can overlap with trade-based money laundering. Banks needed to work more closely with trade finance functions to spot anomalies in shipping, dual-use goods, and sudden new counterparties in high-risk regions. The reports showed that vigilance was required well beyond conventional cash-flow or donation channels.</div>

      <h2>Fraud &amp; Financial Crime — Cases &amp; Trends</h2>
      <h3>Wirecard Collapse</h3>
      <p>On 25 June 2020, Wirecard filed for insolvency after admitting a €1.9bn hole in its accounts.</p>
      <div class="insight">The collapse shook confidence in Europe’s regulatory and audit landscape. It exposed how complex fintech models and weak governance can conceal massive fraud for years. For compliance professionals, it underscored the danger of overreliance on external audits and the need for proactive analytics to spot irregular transaction patterns, even when a firm presents itself as a regulated success story.</div>

      <h3>Continued COVID‑19 Fraud</h3>
      <p>Authorities reported sustained PPE scams, fake charity appeals, and fraudulent loan applications under relief programs.</p>
      <div class="insight">By June, fraud had become more sophisticated, with criminals adapting quickly to new controls. Institutions were urged to refresh monitoring scenarios monthly and share intelligence within industry groups to avoid repeating mistakes across the sector. The persistence of these scams demonstrated that once fraud typologies emerge, they evolve fast and require constant vigilance.</div>

      <h3>Cybercrime Surge: Phishing &amp; Remote-Work Exploits</h3>
      <p>Security agencies reported an increase in phishing and account-takeover attacks targeting remote workers.</p>
      <div class="insight">The surge of cyberattacks revealed the tight connection between IT security and financial crime risk. Remote-access vulnerabilities opened direct channels for fraud and account takeovers. Institutions needed to embed cyber intelligence into AML systems so fraud attempts detected by IT teams could trigger financial-crime reviews before money left the bank.</div>
