      <p>This issue captures key developments across Anti‑Money Laundering (AML), Counter‑Financing of Terrorism (CFT), and Fraud & Financial Crime as at 31 May 2019.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>AML — Regulatory &amp; Policy Developments</h2>
      <h3>Virtual‑asset supervision — global guidance imminent</h3>
      <p>Supervisors signalled that detailed expectations for exchanges, custodial wallets, and other VASPs would be formalised imminently, with emphasis on licensing, CDD, travel‑rule compliance, and ongoing monitoring.</p>
      <div class="insight">Firms inventoried exposure to crypto‑native counterparties, set EDD triggers for higher‑risk patterns, and prepared to implement data‑sharing mechanisms for originator/beneficiary information. Correspondent and payment‑rail relationships were reviewed to prevent risk obfuscation via processors and nested flows.</div>

      <h3>EU 5AMLD — enforcement posture strengthens</h3>
      <p>Member States moved from transposition to active supervision, with a particular focus on beneficial‑ownership register access and usage by obliged entities.</p>
      <div class="insight">Groups aligned KYC to the strictest national baseline, embedded registry look‑ups into onboarding and periodic reviews, and documented how ownership data changed risk ratings, EDD scope, and SAR narratives. Exception handling was tightened where registers were incomplete or conflicted with other sources.</div>

      <h3>6AMLD preparation — predicate‑offence and liability mapping</h3>
      <p>Institutions advanced gap‑analysis for 6AMLD’s expanded predicate offences, aiding/abetting and attempt provisions, and harmonised penalties ahead of 2020 transposition.</p>
      <div class="insight">Compliance, investigations, and legal teams aligned on case‑handling playbooks and record‑keeping standards. Training prioritised serious‑crime typologies and evidentiary discipline so files could withstand prosecutorial scrutiny.</div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>CFT — Counter‑Terrorism Financing</h2>
      <h3>Sanctions maintenance across UN/EU/US regimes</h3>
      <p>Routine listings and amendments in May targeted ISIL/Al‑Qaida affiliates and facilitators, requiring rapid screening updates and disciplined match management.</p>
      <div class="insight">Institutions tightened daily ingestion cadences and validated consistent propagation of list changes across customer, payment, and trade‑finance screening. First‑line teams rehearsed pause‑and‑review procedures and ensured audit‑ready documentation for alert decisions.</div>

      <h3>NPO flows and small‑value payment vigilance</h3>
      <p>Authorities reiterated the TF risks of small, recurring donations routed via online platforms and informal value‑transfer networks.</p>
      <div class="insight">Monitoring scenarios were tuned to detect aggregation across linked accounts and channels; analysts were trained to recognise narratives indicative of misuse. SARs emphasised context—beneficiary links, geography, and purpose—to preserve investigative value for FIUs.</div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Fraud &amp; Financial Crime — Cases &amp; Trends</h2>
      <h3>Ransomware and cyber‑enabled fraud surge</h3>
      <p>Hospitals, municipalities, and enterprises reported disruptive ransomware incidents, with criminals seeking faster payouts via crypto and money‑mule networks.</p>
      <div class="insight">Fraud and AML teams coordinated with cyber to translate indicators (suspicious domains, wallets, IPs) into controls. Banks enhanced SAR narratives with blockchain‑analytics context, implemented cooling‑off periods for first‑time beneficiaries, and reinforced customer education to reduce social‑engineering success.</div>

      <h3>SIM‑swap and account‑takeover techniques evolve</h3>
      <p>Telecom port‑out fraud and OTP interception drove spikes in payment fraud and unauthorised access.</p>
      <div class="insight">Institutions layered device fingerprinting, behavioural biometrics, and out‑of‑band verification for sensitive changes. Payment operations enforced call‑backs for beneficiary edits and monitored velocity on first‑time payments to new payees.</div>

      <h3>Money‑mule recruitment intensifies</h3>
      <p>Seasonal recruitment of students and vulnerable customers increased mule activity used to cash‑out cyber and scam proceeds.</p>
      <div class="insight">Banks implemented targeted education and alerts, tightened controls for high‑risk incoming credits, and tuned monitoring for rapid pass‑through patterns—coordinating with industry sharing groups to disrupt networks.</div>
