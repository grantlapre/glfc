    <section>
      <p>This issue captures key developments across Anti‑Money Laundering (AML), Counter‑Financing of Terrorism (CFT), and Fraud & Financial Crime as at 30 November 2019.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>AML — Regulatory &amp; Policy Developments</h2>
      <h3>EU 5AMLD — final preparations ahead of January 2020 deadline</h3>
      <p>Member States and institutions rushed to finalise compliance with the Fifth AML Directive, expanding coverage to virtual‑asset service providers, prepaid instruments, and beneficial‑ownership transparency.</p>
      <div class="insight">By late 2019, firms accelerated onboarding changes for crypto exchanges and custodial wallets, reviewed prepaid card programs, and ensured access to ownership registers. Supervisors warned of strict enforcement from January, prompting many groups to fast‑track residual remediation projects.</div>

      <h3>6AMLD planning — liability and predicate offences</h3>
      <p>Institutions continued gap‑analyses for 6AMLD’s wider predicate offences, aiding/abetting liability and harmonised penalties due in 2020.</p>
      <div class="insight">Investigations, legal, and HR codified playbooks for case handling, clarified escalation thresholds, and embedded record‑keeping standards. Training plans highlighted serious‑crime typologies and evidentiary discipline to ensure readiness for prosecutorial expectations.</div>

      <h3>FATF follow‑up monitoring</h3>
      <p>Ongoing FATF follow‑up processes sustained pressure on jurisdictions with AML/CFT deficiencies, keeping some countries on increased monitoring lists.</p>
      <div class="insight">Banks refreshed country‑risk ratings, tuned transaction‑monitoring rules for higher‑risk corridors, and re‑evaluated correspondent exposure. Governance reporting began emphasising effectiveness measures—quality SARs and interdictions—over volume metrics.</div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>CFT — Counter‑Terrorism Financing</h2>
      <h3>Sanctions maintenance across UN/EU/US regimes</h3>
      <p>November brought routine terrorism‑related amendments requiring near‑real‑time screening hygiene and disciplined match management.</p>
      <div class="insight">Institutions validated ingestion across screening engines, rehearsed pause‑and‑review steps, and improved documentation to ensure audit‑ready alert decisions while preserving efficiency for clean traffic.</div>

      <h3>Focus on small‑value flows and online fundraising</h3>
      <p>Authorities reiterated the risks of micro‑donations, informal value transfer, and online platforms linked to higher‑risk corridors.</p>
      <div class="insight">Monitoring scenarios were adapted to detect aggregation across linked accounts, while analysts were coached to capture contextual details—geography, beneficiary links, and transaction purpose—in SARs for FIUs.</div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Fraud &amp; Financial Crime — Cases &amp; Trends</h2>
      <h3>Holiday‑season fraud pressures</h3>
      <p>Card‑not‑present fraud, phishing, and mule activity spiked during peak retail periods, with criminals exploiting consumer urgency.</p>
      <div class="insight">Banks layered device fingerprinting and behavioural analytics with transaction velocity limits, enforced call‑back verification for beneficiary changes, and launched customer‑education campaigns. Mule‑account detection was reinforced with device/IP analytics and peer information‑sharing.</div>

      <h3>Ransomware and BEC remain persistent</h3>
      <p>Corporates and municipalities continued to report ransomware and business‑email compromise disrupting financial workflows.</p>
      <div class="insight">AML/fraud teams partnered with cyber to translate indicators (domains, wallets, IPs) into monitoring rules, enriched SAR narratives with blockchain‑analytics context, and recorded remediation gaps to support potential recovery or regulatory action.</div>

      <h3>Emerging deepfake‑enabled fraud</h3>
      <p>Incidents of synthetic audio and video manipulation raised new concerns for identity verification and payment authorisation controls.</p>
      <div class="insight">Programs piloted biometric and behavioural verification for high‑risk transactions, introduced multi‑person approvals, and coached staff on recognising urgency cues and unusual phrasing in potentially manipulated communications.</div>
