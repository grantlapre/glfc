      <p>This issue captures key developments across Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Counter-Financing of Terrorism (CFT), and Fraud & Financial Crime as at 30 September 2020.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>AML — Regulatory &amp; Policy Developments</h2>
      <h3>FinCEN Files leak (20 September 2020)</h3>
      <p>The ICIJ published investigative reporting based on leaked Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs), raising concerns about global AML effectiveness and information-sharing outcomes.</p>
      <div class="insight">The unprecedented release of SAR-derived material catalysed a worldwide debate about whether filing volume translates into impact. Boards and regulators began pressing for clearer evidence that AML programs disrupt criminal networks rather than merely generate paperwork. Many institutions used the moment to revisit how investigative narratives connect to actionable law-enforcement leads, to improve feedback loops with FIUs, and to recalibrate metrics from process counts toward demonstrable outcomes.</div>

      <h3>EU signals intent to propose a centralised AML authority</h3>
      <p>Following the Action Plan consultation, the European Commission reiterated its plan to table proposals for an EU-level AML supervisor in 2021.</p>
      <div class="insight">The shift toward supranational supervision implied fewer national divergences and tighter oversight of cross-border groups. Compliance leaders mapped where policies would need harmonisation, assessed group-wide data architecture for consolidated reporting, and stress-tested governance so that accountability could withstand direct scrutiny from a central EU authority.</div>

      <h3>U.S. Congress advances AMLA 2020</h3>
      <p>Late-September movement kept the Anti-Money Laundering Act on track, including creation of a federal beneficial-ownership reporting regime.</p>
      <div class="insight">Even ahead of enactment, firms started planning for integration of a central BO registry into KYC workflows. Operational playbooks anticipated relief from piecemeal collection of ownership data but added responsibilities to validate filings, reconcile discrepancies, and capture audit trails showing how registry information informed risk decisions.</div>

    <section>
      <h2>CFT — Counter‑Terrorism Financing</h2>
      <h3>UN sanctions updates (September 2020)</h3>
      <p>New and amended designations targeted ISIL/Al-Qaida affiliates and related networks, requiring prompt screening updates and outreach where exposure existed.</p>
      <div class="insight">The cadence of listings during a pandemic reinforced the need for near-real-time list ingestion and reconciliation across screening tools. Front-line teams refined pause-and-review procedures so potential matches could be triaged quickly, with documentation robust enough for audit and supervisory scrutiny.</div>

      <h3>FATF highlights TF risks during COVID-19</h3>
      <p>FATF communications stressed that extremist groups were using online platforms, micro-donations, and virtual assets to raise and move funds.</p>
      <div class="insight">For financial institutions, the update expanded the surveillance lens beyond traditional cash and hawala channels. Typology models increasingly looked for patterns of small, frequent transfers across linked accounts and wallets, cross-referenced with campaign narratives that played on humanitarian themes.</div>

      <h2>Fraud &amp; Financial Crime — Cases &amp; Trends</h2>
      <h3>FinCEN advisory on unemployment insurance fraud</h3>
      <p>FinCEN issued red flags on pandemic-related U.S. unemployment benefit fraud, including identity theft, synthetic IDs, and mule-account flows.</p>
      <div class="insight">The advisory crystallised best practices that banks had been developing since spring. Institutions tightened velocity and anomaly checks on benefit deposits, linked device/IP intelligence to beneficiary profiles, and coordinated with state agencies to exchange indicators that could stop serial abuse across multiple institutions.</div>

      <h3>Danske Bank settlement discussions</h3>
      <p>Media reports indicated Danske Bank was nearing resolution with U.S. and Danish authorities over its Estonian branch scandal.</p>
      <div class="insight">Even before any settlement, the case served as a board-level lesson in cross-border exposure. It reinforced the need for strong affiliate oversight, independent testing of high-risk branches, and clear escalation channels when local compliance concerns are not resolved swiftly.</div>

      <h3>COVID-19 fraud schemes continue</h3>
      <p>Authorities documented ongoing PPE scams, fraudulent business loans, phishing, and account-takeover attacks.</p>
      <div class="insight">By September, fraudsters had adapted to more mature controls with layered mule networks and realistic documentation. Firms refreshed monitoring scenarios, expanded training for frontline staff, and shared threat intelligence through industry fora to keep pace with evolving techniques.</div>
