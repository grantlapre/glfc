      <h3>The New Fifth Pillar of BSA/AML Compliance</h3>
      <p class="deck">FinCEN‚Äôs CDD Beneficial Ownership Rule adds a fifth pillar: BO identification, risk profiling, and ongoing monitoring.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>For decades, U.S. financial institutions have been expected to maintain four key elements of a BSA/AML compliance program: (1) internal policies and controls, (2) a designated compliance officer, (3) ongoing training, and (4) independent review. In 2016, <strong>FinCEN‚Äôs Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Final Rule</strong> introduced a <strong>fifth pillar</strong> that came fully into effect on <strong>11 May 2018</strong>. Covered institutions‚Äîincluding banks, broker-dealers, mutual funds, futures commission merchants, and introducing brokers‚Äîmust now identify and verify the <strong>beneficial owners</strong> of legal-entity customers. They must also understand the nature and purpose of customer relationships, develop risk profiles, and conduct ongoing monitoring to update information and file SARs as appropriate. The rule was designed to close gaps around shell and anonymous companies, and to standardize practices that had been applied unevenly. For AMLCOs, the fifth pillar codified customer-risk understanding as central to program effectiveness.</p>

      <h3>APRA Criticises Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA)</h3>
      <p class="deck">APRA‚Äôs prudential inquiry cites cultural and governance failings; CBA to hold extra AUD 1bn capital.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>On <strong>1 May 2018</strong>, the <strong>Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA)</strong> released a scathing report on the <strong>Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA)</strong>, highlighting deep cultural and governance failings. The 110-page report found that CBA‚Äôs ‚Äúcontinued financial success dulled the senses of the institution‚Äù and created a complacent, insular culture. Failures included ineffective board oversight, a lack of accountability among senior executives, risk ownership gaps, and remuneration systems that rewarded growth without adequately considering compliance. APRA concluded that management often dismissed regulatory concerns, leading to delayed action on AML/CFT issues flagged by AUSTRAC. Treasurer <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> described the report as ‚Äúrequired reading‚Äù for all Australian financial institutions. As part of enforcement, APRA required CBA to set aside an extra <strong>AUD 1&nbsp;billion</strong> in capital until governance and risk culture were demonstrably improved. For AMLCOs, the case underscores how culture translates directly into control failures.</p>

      <h3>EU Parliament Approves 5AMLD</h3>
      <p class="deck">Parliament backs stronger BO access, prepaid thresholds, crypto scope, FIU cooperation, and account registries.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>On <strong>19 April 2018</strong>, the <strong>European Parliament</strong> voted to adopt the <strong>Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD)</strong>, a landmark package strengthening the EU‚Äôs AML framework. 5AMLD requires member states to establish <strong>centralised bank and payment account registries</strong>, expand <strong>public access to beneficial ownership registers</strong>, and extend AML obligations to <strong>virtual currency exchanges</strong> and <strong>custodian wallet providers</strong>. It also lowers identification thresholds for prepaid cards, strengthens enhanced due diligence on high-risk countries, and improves cross-border FIU cooperation. The directive was a direct response to the Panama Papers and other financial crime scandals, reflecting growing EU determination to tackle opacity in financial flows. For AMLCOs, 5AMLD set a clear timetable for significant policy and procedural updates across Europe, particularly in onboarding, BO verification, and crypto-asset monitoring.</p>

      <h3>FinCEN Issues FAQs on Beneficial Ownership/CDD Rule</h3>
      <p class="deck">FAQs (FIN‚Äë2018‚ÄëG001) clarify 25% ownership + control prong, updating BO data, and risk-based application.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>On <strong>3 April 2018</strong>, <strong>FinCEN</strong> published detailed <strong>FAQs (FIN-2018-G001)</strong> to clarify expectations under the <strong>Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Beneficial Ownership Rule</strong>, which became enforceable on 11 May 2018. The FAQs addressed key operational questions: how to apply the <strong>25% ownership test plus one control prong</strong>; treatment of multiple accounts for the same customer; interaction with existing risk-based CDD practices; and updating customer information when risk profiles change. FinCEN stressed that the rule codifies practices many institutions already followed but now sets a binding baseline. For AML professionals, the guidance provided practical direction to finalise policies, systems, and training in advance of the compliance deadline. It also reinforced expectations that BO data should be actively maintained and leveraged in suspicious activity monitoring.</p>

      <h3>RBI Orders Banks to Exit Virtual Currency Relationships</h3>
      <p class="deck">RBI bans regulated entities from servicing crypto activity; 3‚Äëmonth wind‚Äëdown window.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>On <strong>6 April 2018</strong>, the <strong>Reserve Bank of India (RBI)</strong> issued a circular prohibiting all regulated entities‚Äîincluding banks, NBFCs, and payment service providers‚Äîfrom providing services to any business dealing in <strong>virtual currencies</strong>. Institutions were given <strong>three months</strong> to unwind existing relationships. The RBI cited consumer protection, market integrity, and money laundering concerns, noting that crypto-assets posed systemic risks without legal tender status. The move effectively forced Indian exchanges to seek offshore banking solutions or wind down operations. For AMLCOs, the RBI ban highlighted how regulators in emerging markets may adopt de‚Äërisking approaches to virtual assets rather than incremental regulation. Financial institutions with exposure to Indian counterparties needed to review customer files, exit processes, and communications to ensure compliance with the prohibition.</p>

      <h3>Australia Brings Digital Currency Exchanges into AML Regime</h3>
      <p class="deck">From 3 Apr, DCEs must register with AUSTRAC, perform KYC, report SMRs/threshold cash, and keep records.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>On <strong>3 April 2018</strong>, <strong>AUSTRAC</strong> announced that <strong>Digital Currency Exchanges (DCEs)</strong> are now formally regulated under the <strong>AML/CTF Act</strong>. From this date, DCEs operating in Australia must <strong>register with AUSTRAC</strong>, conduct <strong>customer identification and verification</strong> (KYC), monitor and report <strong>suspicious matters</strong>, file <strong>threshold transaction reports</strong> for cash ‚â• AUD 10,000, and maintain records. Registration requires key personnel to pass suitability checks, and non-compliant operators face civil and criminal penalties. The reform made Australia one of the first jurisdictions to explicitly bring virtual currency providers into its AML regime. For AML officers, the change underscored the need to identify counterparties with crypto exposure, assess whether they are AUSTRAC-registered, and update due diligence policies to reflect new obligations. The move also foreshadowed FATF‚Äôs 2019 global standards for virtual assets.</p>

      <h3>UK Sanctions & AML Bill Nears Completion</h3>
      <p class="deck">Bill advances through final Commons stages; Overseas Territories BO transparency thrust into focus.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>In <strong>late April 2018</strong>, the UK Parliament advanced the <strong>Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Bill</strong> through its final Commons stages. The Bill was designed to give the UK autonomous sanctions powers post‚ÄëBrexit while strengthening the domestic AML framework. A major point of debate concerned beneficial ownership transparency in the <strong>Overseas Territories</strong>. MPs pressed for a requirement that territories establish <strong>public registers of company owners by 2020</strong>, sparking political pushback but signalling Parliament‚Äôs intent. For AML practitioners, the Bill represented a substantial governance shift: firms needed to anticipate changes in sanctions regimes and prepare for stricter transparency standards in cross‚Äëborder structures. The legislation also paved the way for enhanced UK enforcement powers once enacted.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>On <strong>26 April 2018</strong>, the <strong>European Parliament‚Äôs Special Committee on Financial Crimes, Tax Evasion and Tax Avoidance (TAX3)</strong> held a high‚Äëprofile hearing on AML/CFT risks. Experts and officials discussed recent scandals, including the closure of Estonia‚Äôs <strong>Versobank</strong>, and systemic weaknesses in supervision and information‚Äësharing. TAX3 members stressed the need for consistent application of 4AMLD and the forthcoming 5AMLD, alongside stronger oversight of cross‚Äëborder banking. For AML compliance officers, TAX3‚Äôs hearings provided valuable signals about political and regulatory priorities‚Äîparticularly scrutiny of Baltic non‚Äëresident business models and correspondent banking practices. Firms with EU exposure were advised to follow TAX3 proceedings closely, as recommendations could shape future directives and supervisory expectations.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>In <strong>April 2018</strong>, the <strong>Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies (CCAB)</strong> published updated AML guidance under the <strong>Money Laundering Regulations 2017</strong>, which received <strong>HM Treasury approval</strong>. The guidance provided practical expectations for accountants and firms providing related services, covering customer risk assessment, CDD/ECDD, ongoing monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting. It also clarified requirements for firm‚Äëwide risk assessments and emphasised the importance of documenting rationale for higher‚Äërisk relationships. For financial institutions, the update served as a useful comparator for professional‚Äëservices risk, especially where banks rely on accountants and auditors as gatekeepers. Compliance teams were advised to familiarise themselves with the guidance, both for onboarding such firms and for aligning expectations in group‚Äëwide training.</p>
