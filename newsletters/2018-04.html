      <h3>Security Policy for IT</h3>
      <p class="deck">Clear, enforced IT security policy underpins AML system reliability, data protection and incident response.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>As financial institutions digitize more services, a comprehensive <strong>IT security policy</strong> has become essential to protecting systems and data against cybercrime. A strong policy should define responsibilities across business units and embed safeguards into daily operations. Core principles include the <strong>CIA triad</strong> (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability), supported by controls such as separation of duties, job rotation, incident response planning, forensic testing, and regular training. Organizations must also develop specific standards on incident handling, acceptable use of email, and business continuity/disaster recovery (BCP/DR). Stakeholder involvement‚Äîfrom HR, Legal, and Management to external vendors and regulators‚Äîensures coverage of operational and compliance risks. For AML compliance officers, IT security policy is not a separate silo: it directly impacts monitoring system reliability, SAR reporting timeliness, and customer data protection. Institutions that document, test, and enforce these policies demonstrate governance maturity and resilience against financial crime threats.</p>

      <h3>Data Breaches Strike CareFirst & Under Armour</h3>
      <p class="deck">Two high‚Äëprofile breaches and a 911 ransomware incident spotlight AML‚Äërelevant cyber risk.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>In <strong>April 2018</strong>, two major data breaches underscored the rising scale of cyber risk. <strong>CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield</strong> (Maryland) confirmed that a phishing attack exposed personal data of approximately <strong>6,800 members</strong>, including names, identification numbers, and dates of birth; a limited number of Social Security numbers were also compromised. Meanwhile, <strong>Under Armour</strong> revealed its popular <strong>MyFitnessPal app</strong> had been hacked, affecting an estimated <strong>150 million users</strong>. Compromised data included usernames, hashed passwords, and email addresses. In the same week, the <strong>City of Baltimore</strong> was hit by a ransomware attack that temporarily disabled its 911 dispatch system, highlighting risks to public infrastructure. For AML compliance officers, these incidents reinforce the importance of cybersecurity in protecting customer data and ensuring continuity of monitoring systems. Breaches can expose institutions to identity theft, account‚Äëtakeover, and fraud typologies‚Äîall of which drive downstream AML risks.</p>

      <h3>G20 Calls FATF to Act on Crypto‚ÄëAssets</h3>
      <p class="deck">G20 tasks FATF to develop global AML/CFT standards for crypto‚Äëassets and report back by July 2018.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>At the <strong>G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting in Buenos Aires (19‚Äì20 March 2018)</strong>, leaders agreed that <strong>crypto‚Äëassets</strong> could pose serious risks for money laundering and terrorist financing. They tasked the <strong>Financial Action Task Force (FATF)</strong> with developing clear global standards for virtual assets and reporting back by July 2018. The G20 also highlighted concerns over tax evasion and investor protection. For AML compliance officers, this announcement signaled a turning point: crypto‚Äëasset service providers, exchanges, and custodians would soon face FATF‚Äëdriven obligations for customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting. Financial institutions with indirect exposure through payments or correspondent lines were urged to begin preparing for enhanced due diligence on counterparties active in the digital asset space.</p>

      <h3>RBI Scraps LoUs/LoCs After PNB Fraud</h3>
      <p class="deck">Trade‚Äëcredit LoUs/LoCs discontinued; banks must rely on LCs/guarantees and tighten controls.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>On <strong>13 March 2018</strong>, the <strong>Reserve Bank of India (RBI)</strong> announced the immediate discontinuation of <strong>Letters of Undertaking (LoUs)</strong> and <strong>Letters of Comfort (LoCs)</strong> as instruments for trade credit. The decision followed the discovery of the <strong>Punjab National Bank (PNB)</strong> fraud, where rogue staff issued unauthorized LoUs through SWIFT, enabling overseas borrowing that eventually cost the bank over <strong>$1.7 billion</strong>. RBI directed that trade credit should henceforth rely only on Letters of Credit (LCs) and bank guarantees, which provide stronger checks. For compliance teams, this was a clear signal to tighten oversight of trade‚Äëfinance processes, especially SWIFT integration, system reconciliations, and manual workarounds. Institutions exposed to Indian trade flows were reminded to revisit risk assessments, monitor correspondent relationships, and strengthen documentary credit controls.</p>

      <h3>Pilatus Bank Owner Arrested; MFSA Steps In</h3>
      <p class="deck">U.S. charges Ali Sadr; Malta‚Äôs regulator appoints a competent person to control the bank.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>On <strong>20 March 2018</strong>, U.S. prosecutors charged <strong>Ali Sadr Hashemi Nejad</strong>, owner of Malta‚Äôs <strong>Pilatus Bank</strong>, with sanctions evasion and money laundering tied to a scheme involving Venezuela and Iranian‚Äëlinked companies. He was arrested in the U.S., triggering swift regulatory action in Malta. The <strong>Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA)</strong> appointed a ‚Äúcompetent person‚Äù to assume control of Pilatus Bank, effectively sidelining its management. Pilatus had long faced allegations of handling politically exposed persons (PEPs) and opaque funds. The case rattled Malta‚Äôs banking sector and raised questions over the island‚Äôs AML oversight, particularly given its reliance on financial services and international investors. For AML compliance officers, the Pilatus case highlights the importance of sanctions screening, robust PEP onboarding, and the reputational risks of banking opaque or high‚Äërisk clients.</p>

      <h3>UN Expands DPRK Sanctions (Ships & Entities)</h3>
      <p class="deck">1718 Committee adds 27 ships and 22 entities; maritime due diligence must be tightened.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>On <strong>30 March 2018</strong>, the <strong>UN Security Council‚Äôs 1718 Committee</strong> adopted measures adding <strong>27 ships and 22 entities</strong> to its list of North Korea‚Äërelated sanctions. The listings targeted vessels and companies involved in ship‚Äëto‚Äëship transfers of coal, oil, and other sanctioned goods designed to evade embargoes. The action reinforced earlier designations aimed at cutting off DPRK‚Äôs access to foreign currency and materials supporting its weapons program. For financial institutions, the designations meant immediate updates to sanctions‚Äëscreening lists, vessel tracking, and trade‚Äëfinance monitoring. Compliance teams supporting global shipping, commodity trade, or correspondent banks with maritime exposure were reminded to scrutinize vessel ownership structures, flag registrations, and any payments connected to high‚Äërisk shipping corridors. The case further illustrated how maritime evasion tactics have become a central AML/CFT concern.</p>

      <h3>European Parliament Establishes TAX3</h3>
      <p class="deck">New committee targets financial crimes, tax evasion/avoidance, and AML loopholes.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>On <strong>1 March 2018</strong>, the <strong>European Parliament</strong> voted to create the <strong>Special Committee on Financial Crimes, Tax Evasion and Tax Avoidance (TAX3)</strong>. The new body, with 45 members, was tasked with investigating recent financial scandals such as the Paradise Papers, assessing loopholes in tax and AML legislation, and proposing reforms for greater transparency. TAX3‚Äôs remit included beneficial ownership registers, whistleblower protections, and stronger supervision of financial institutions. For AML professionals, the creation of TAX3 signaled a higher political commitment within the EU to integrate tax transparency and AML agendas. The committee‚Äôs findings were expected to influence the implementation of 5AMLD and shape subsequent EU legislative packages. Institutions were advised to monitor TAX3‚Äôs proceedings for emerging compliance expectations on beneficial ownership, tax‚Äëlinked risks, and cross‚Äëborder reporting obligations.</p>

      <h3>U.S. Court Confirms CFTC Authority over Virtual Currencies</h3>
      <p class="deck">Federal court (McDonnell) holds virtual currencies are commodities under the CEA.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>On <strong>6 March 2018</strong>, a <strong>federal court in New York (CFTC v. McDonnell)</strong> ruled that <strong>virtual currencies qualify as commodities</strong> under the <strong>Commodity Exchange Act</strong>, confirming the Commodity Futures Trading Commission‚Äôs jurisdiction to prosecute crypto‚Äëfraud. The decision strengthened the CFTC‚Äôs hand in bringing enforcement cases against individuals and platforms engaged in deceptive schemes involving Bitcoin and other tokens. For AML officers, the case illustrated the convergence of market integrity and financial crime controls in the digital‚Äëasset sector. Exchanges and intermediaries dealing in crypto‚Äëassets could no longer assume a regulatory grey area; U.S. courts had affirmed oversight and enforcement reach. Compliance programs covering crypto‚Äëexposure should integrate CFTC guidance alongside SEC, FinCEN, and FATF frameworks, ensuring consistency in transaction monitoring, fraud detection, and suspicious activity reporting.</p>

      <h3>Nigeria Moves to Secure FIU Independence</h3>
      <p class="deck">Legislation advances to make NFIU autonomous; key to Egmont Group compliance.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Read the short extract</summary>
        <p>In <strong>March 2018</strong>, both chambers of Nigeria‚Äôs National Assembly passed legislation granting autonomy to the <strong>Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU)</strong>. The reform was designed to address concerns from the <strong>Egmont Group of FIUs</strong>, which had suspended Nigeria in 2017 due to political interference in its FIU. By making the NFIU independent from the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Nigeria aimed to restore Egmont membership and reassure correspondent banks of its AML commitment. For global financial institutions, this development signaled potential improvement in Nigeria‚Äôs AML/CFT framework and reduced risk of international isolation. Compliance teams with Nigerian counterparties were encouraged to follow the bill‚Äôs implementation and adjust their risk ratings accordingly, particularly given Nigeria‚Äôs role as a key financial hub in West Africa.</p>
