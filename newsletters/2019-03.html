      <p>This issue captures key developments across Anti‑Money Laundering (AML), Counter‑Financing of Terrorism (CFT), and Fraud & Financial Crime as at 28 February 2019.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>AML — Regulatory &amp; Policy Developments</h2>
      <h3>FATF February Plenary — outcomes and monitoring</h3>
      <p>FATF concluded its February meeting with continued monitoring of several jurisdictions and reiterated counter‑measures for Iran while Pakistan remained under increased monitoring.</p>
      <div class="insight">Institutions refreshed country risk ratings and validated that EDD triggers were aligned to current FATF positions. Banks with exposure to higher‑risk corridors stress‑tested correspondent arrangements, tuned wire‑payment monitoring for relevant red flags, and ensured sanctions/AML controls were acting cohesively across lines of defense.</div>

      <h3>EU 5AMLD — implementation moves into enforcement phase</h3>
      <p>Following the January deadline, Member States progressed national enforcement and supervisory expectations for virtual‑asset service providers, prepaid instruments, and beneficial‑ownership access.</p>
      <div class="insight">Cross‑border groups mapped national deltas and standardised KYC controls to the strictest baseline. Teams embedded registry look‑ups into onboarding and review cycles, designed exception handling for incomplete registers, and documented how ownership data influenced risk decisions and SAR narratives.</div>

      <h3>6AMLD preparation begins across the EU</h3>
      <p>With transposition due in 2020, firms began planning for 6AMLD’s expanded list of predicate offences, complicity liability, and harmonised penalties.</p>
      <div class="insight">Compliance leaders kicked off gap analyses spanning investigations, legal, and HR to clarify roles, escalation thresholds, and record‑keeping. Training plans prioritised serious‑crime typologies and documentation standards so case files could meet raised prosecutorial expectations.</div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>CFT — Counter‑Terrorism Financing</h2>
      <h3>Sanctions maintenance — UN/US/EU updates</h3>
      <p>February brought routine listings and amendments targeting ISIL/Al‑Qaida affiliates and facilitators across several regions.</p>
      <div class="insight">Institutions tightened ingestion cadences to daily or better and verified that watchlist changes propagated consistently across customer, payment, and trade‑finance screening. First‑line teams rehearsed pause‑and‑review steps and ensured audit‑ready documentation for alert disposition.</div>

      <h3>NPO and small‑value flow vigilance</h3>
      <p>Supervisors reiterated risks associated with small recurring donations and informal value transfer channels linked to higher‑risk jurisdictions.</p>
      <div class="insight">Monitoring scenarios were adapted to spot aggregation across linked accounts and channels. Banks combined behavioural indicators with merchant/category data and emphasised narrative quality in SARs to preserve investigative value for FIUs.</div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Fraud &amp; Financial Crime — Cases &amp; Trends</h2>
      <h3>Account takeover and phishing waves persist</h3>
      <p>Credential‑stuffing and phishing activity stayed elevated following large breach disclosures earlier in the year.</p>
      <div class="insight">Fraud teams implemented device fingerprinting, IP risk scoring, and step‑up authentication on anomalous events. Customer‑education campaigns targeted password hygiene and social‑engineering awareness to reduce downstream fraud losses.</div>

      <h3>Payment institutions — agent and programme‑manager oversight</h3>
      <p>European supervisors scrutinised outsourcing and safeguarding arrangements in fast‑growing payments firms.</p>
      <div class="insight">Banks and PSPs tightened contractual controls, ensured sub‑merchant monitoring coverage, and reconciled safeguarding accounts more frequently. The focus reduced blind spots where higher‑risk MCCs or cross‑border e‑commerce could slip past onboarding guardrails.</div>

      <h3>Nordic/Baltic legacy flows remain under investigation</h3>
      <p>Authorities continued probes into historic non‑resident flows through Baltic branches, keeping risk appetite constrained for correspondent relationships.</p>
      <div class="insight">Boards required independent look‑backs, refreshed risk assessments for non‑resident portfolios, and enhanced whistleblower protections. Correspondent banks sought clearer remediation evidence before normalising limits or pricing.</div>
