      <p>This issue captures key developments across Anti‑Money Laundering (AML), Counter‑Financing of Terrorism (CFT), and Fraud & Financial Crime as at 31 July 2020.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>AML — Regulatory &amp; Policy Developments</h2>
      <h3>EU AML/CFT Action Plan consultation period closed (29 July 2020)</h3>
      <p>The European Commission concluded its consultation on the six‑pillar Action Plan, paving the way for legislative proposals and a potential EU‑level AML authority.</p>
      <div class="insight">The close of the consultation marked a shift from concept to drafting, signalling that the policy direction was largely set. Cross‑border institutions began planning for fewer national discrepancies, stronger expectations on effectiveness, and a supervisory model that would scrutinise outcomes rather than box‑ticking. Many firms also reviewed their beneficial‑ownership controls and FIU engagement processes in anticipation of a single rulebook and more coordinated information‑sharing across the bloc.</div>

      <h3>US Anti‑Money Laundering Act of 2020 progress</h3>
      <p>Bipartisan support advanced congressional discussions around the AMLA 2020 package, including beneficial‑ownership reporting at incorporation.</p>
      <div class="insight">Even before enactment, the legislative momentum in July pointed to a fundamental change in the U.S. transparency regime. A federal reporting requirement promised to reduce the burden on banks to collect opaque ownership data piecemeal, while introducing new obligations to validate disclosures and reconcile them with customer‑due‑diligence records. Institutions prepared to align onboarding playbooks, vendor integrations, and training to a world where corporate opacity would face tighter constraints.</div>

      <h3>HKMA circular on remote onboarding</h3>
      <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued guidance endorsing biometric and digital‑ID technologies for customer onboarding.</p>
      <div class="insight">Regulatory acceptance of remote verification tools accelerated digital transformation without relaxing AML/CFT safeguards. Compliance leaders used the circular to justify investment in video KYC, liveness detection, and e‑KYC vendors, while legal and risk teams strengthened vendor due‑diligence questionnaires, data‑protection assessments, and fallback procedures for high‑risk cases or technology outages.</div>

      <h2>CFT — Counter‑Terrorism Financing</h2>
      <h3>FATF report on ISIL/Al‑Qaida financing trends</h3>
      <p>FATF analysed adaptations in terror‑finance networks, including greater reliance on small cross‑border transfers and use of virtual assets.</p>
      <div class="insight">As traditional channels were disrupted, networks fragmented flows into smaller transactions and leveraged informal and digital rails to evade detection. Financial institutions responded by tightening controls around micro‑payments, monitoring sequential transfers across linked accounts, and building alert logic that aggregates small‑value activity to reveal patterns that would be invisible in isolation.</div>

      <h3>Sanctions designations by UN and OFAC</h3>
      <p>New listings and amendments targeted individuals and entities linked to global terrorism, requiring rapid screening updates.</p>
      <div class="insight">The designations tested the speed and integrity of sanctions operations. Automated list ingestion, reconciliation across multiple providers, and robust alert‑quality tuning became critical, while front‑line teams needed crisp communications to pause transactions, confirm true matches, and document resolution steps in case of regulatory review.</div>

      <h2>Fraud &amp; Financial Crime — Cases &amp; Trends</h2>
      <h3>Goldman Sachs 1MDB settlement with Malaysia</h3>
      <p>Malaysia and Goldman Sachs reached a US$3.9bn settlement related to the 1MDB scandal.</p>
      <div class="insight">The resolution underscored the scale of exposure when governance and due diligence fail around complex capital‑markets deals. It catalysed board‑level conversations on third‑party risk, the independence of control functions, and the necessity of challenging profitable transactions that carry integrity concerns. Institutions took the moment to tighten deal‑approval gateways and expand pre‑transaction red‑flag reviews.</div>

      <h3>COVID‑19 stimulus fraud continues</h3>
      <p>Authorities in the U.S. and EU reported hundreds of ongoing investigations into fraudulent pandemic‑relief claims.</p>
      <div class="insight">By July, fraudsters had refined their methods, mixing synthetic identities, account takeovers, and mule networks to exploit relief programs at scale. Banks responded by recalibrating monitoring thresholds to expected payment schedules, sharing indicators with government agencies, and deploying device/IP analytics to identify coordinated rings rather than isolated events.</div>

      <h3>FCA enforcement focus on systems and controls</h3>
      <p>The UK Financial Conduct Authority increased scrutiny of AML systems and controls, issuing public warnings to lagging firms.</p>
      <div class="insight">The tone from the FCA signalled that remote work would not excuse weak frameworks. Supervisors expected demonstrable effectiveness—clear MI on alert handling, QA metrics, and tangible remediation progress. Firms prioritised model‑risk assessments for monitoring systems, uplifted skills in first‑line operations, and revisited governance to ensure rapid escalation and decision‑making when red flags surfaced.</div>
