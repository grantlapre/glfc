      <p>This issue captures key developments across Anti‑Money Laundering (AML), Counter‑Financing of Terrorism (CFT), and Fraud & Financial Crime as at 30 April 2019.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>AML — Regulatory &amp; Policy Developments</h2>
      <h3>EU 5AMLD — supervisory follow‑through intensifies</h3>
      <p>Post‑deadline, Member State supervisors sharpened expectations for virtual‑asset service providers, prepaid instruments, and beneficial‑ownership register access and usage.</p>
      <div class="insight">Groups operating across multiple EU markets harmonised KYC to the strictest baseline and embedded registry look‑ups into onboarding and reviews. Teams documented how ownership data informed risk ratings and SAR narratives and tightened oversight of distributors and agents where onboarding happened outside branches.</div>

      <h3>6AMLD readiness — gap‑analyses underway</h3>
      <p>Firms advanced planning for the Sixth AML Directive’s wider predicate offences, complicity liability, and harmonised penalties ahead of 2020 transposition.</p>
      <div class="insight">Compliance, investigations, and legal functions aligned on case‑handling playbooks and record‑keeping standards. Training pipelines prioritised serious‑crime typologies and evidentiary discipline, anticipating prosecutors’ higher expectations for corporate accountability.</div>

      <h3>Virtual‑asset compliance — industry prepares for FATF guidance</h3>
      <p>With global attention on upcoming FATF clarifications for Recommendation 15, supervisors signalled stronger expectations for exchanges, custodial wallets, and payment intermediaries.</p>
      <div class="insight">Banks mapped exposure to crypto‑native businesses and processors, set clear EDD triggers, and refined monitoring for exchange‑to‑exchange flows, mixers, and rapid in/out patterns. Correspondent and payment‑rail relationships were reviewed to prevent risk obfuscation in aggregate flows.</div>

    <section>
      <h2>CFT — Counter‑Terrorism Financing</h2>
      <h3>UN/EU/US sanctions maintenance and alert quality</h3>
      <p>April brought routine additions and amendments across terrorism‑related lists, requiring near‑real‑time screening hygiene and disciplined match management.</p>
      <div class="insight">Institutions verified propagation of list updates across customer, payment, and trade‑finance screening engines. First‑line teams rehearsed pause‑and‑review and improved documentation quality so alert decisions were audit‑ready while keeping straight‑through processing efficient for clean traffic.</div>

      <h3>NPO and small‑value payment vigilance</h3>
      <p>Authorities reiterated the risk of small, recurring donations routed via online platforms or informal value‑transfer channels into higher‑risk corridors.</p>
      <div class="insight">Monitoring scenarios were tuned to spot aggregation across linked accounts and channels, with analysts trained to recognise narratives indicative of misuse. SARs emphasised context—beneficiary links, geography, and payment purpose—to preserve investigative value for FIUs.</div>

      <h2>Fraud &amp; Financial Crime — Cases &amp; Trends</h2>
      <h3>Tax‑season BEC and payroll diversion schemes</h3>
      <p>Financial institutions reported continued attempts to redirect payroll deposits and supplier payments via spoofed emails and compromised accounts.</p>
      <div class="insight">Fraud teams enforced call‑back verification for bank‑detail changes, velocity limits on first‑time beneficiaries, and cooling‑off periods for high‑risk edits. Customer‑education campaigns targeted finance and HR teams to reduce social‑engineering susceptibility.</div>

      <h3>Account‑takeover risk from credential dumps</h3>
      <p>Large credential compilations continued to fuel credential‑stuffing and downstream account‑takeover across consumer platforms.</p>
      <div class="insight">Banks deployed device fingerprinting and IP risk scoring, applied step‑up authentication on anomalous events, and launched targeted password‑reset campaigns for exposed cohorts to dampen losses.</div>

      <h3>Trade‑based money laundering scrutiny</h3>
      <p>Industry groups and authorities flagged TBML typologies around over/under‑invoicing, phantom shipments, and high‑risk commodities.</p>
      <div class="insight">Institutions strengthened collaboration between trade‑finance ops and AML investigations, cross‑checking documents against shipment data and pricing benchmarks. EDD focused on intermediaries, dual‑use goods, and sudden trade‑pattern shifts.</div>
