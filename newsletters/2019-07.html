      <p>This issue captures key developments across Anti‑Money Laundering (AML), Counter‑Financing of Terrorism (CFT), and Fraud & Financial Crime as at 30 June 2019.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>AML — Regulatory &amp; Policy Developments</h2>
      <h3>FATF finalises virtual‑asset guidance and the “travel rule”</h3>
      <p>FATF concluded work to clarify Recommendation 15 and its Interpretive Note for virtual‑asset service providers (VASPs), setting expectations for licensing/registration, CDD, suspicious reporting, and transmission of originator/beneficiary information (“travel rule”).</p>
      <div class="insight">Compliance leaders treated the guidance as the global baseline for crypto supervision. Banks inventoried exposure to exchanges, OTC brokers, and processors; defined EDD triggers for high‑risk flows; and began scoping data‑sharing solutions to exchange originator/beneficiary information between VASPs. Correspondent and payment‑rail relationships were reviewed to prevent risk obfuscation via nested processors and to align sanctions/AML monitoring across fiat–crypto touchpoints.</div>

      <h3>EU 5AMLD — enforcement posture sharpens</h3>
      <p>Following January’s deadline, supervisors increased scrutiny of how obliged entities access and use beneficial‑ownership registers and control VASP and prepaid‑instrument risks.</p>
      <div class="insight">Groups standardised KYC to the strictest national baseline, embedded registry look‑ups into onboarding and periodic reviews, and recorded how ownership data drove risk decisions and SAR narratives. Exception handling matured for incomplete or conflicting registry entries, with remediation SLAs and audit trails to evidence effectiveness.</div>

      <h3>6AMLD planning — predicate‑offence and liability mapping</h3>
      <p>Firms advanced gap‑analyses to prepare for 6AMLD’s expanded predicate offences, aiding/abetting and attempt provisions, and tougher harmonised penalties.</p>
      <div class="insight">Investigations, legal, and HR aligned on playbooks for complex cases, clarified escalation thresholds, and tightened record‑keeping standards. Training pipelines emphasised serious‑crime typologies and evidentiary discipline so case files can support potential prosecution.</div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>CFT — Counter‑Terrorism Financing</h2>
      <h3>Sanctions maintenance across UN/EU/US regimes</h3>
      <p>June saw routine additions and amendments to terrorism‑related lists, requiring near‑real‑time updates and consistent alert handling across systems.</p>
      <div class="insight">Institutions verified that list changes propagated across customer, payments, trade‑finance and cards screening, rehearsed pause‑and‑review protocols, and improved documentation quality so decisions are audit‑ready while preserving straight‑through processing for clean traffic.</div>

      <h3>NPO and small‑value flows — continued vigilance</h3>
      <p>Authorities reiterated TF risks in small recurring donations via online platforms and informal value‑transfer networks into higher‑risk corridors.</p>
      <div class="insight">Monitoring scenarios were tuned to detect aggregation across linked accounts and channels; analysts were trained to recognise narratives indicative of misuse. SARs emphasised context—beneficiary links, geography and purpose—to preserve investigative value for FIUs.</div>

      <h2>Fraud &amp; Financial Crime — Cases &amp; Trends</h2>
      <h3>Ransomware and cyber‑enabled fraud intensify</h3>
      <p>Enterprises and municipalities reported disruptive ransomware incidents, with criminals seeking rapid payouts via crypto and money‑mule networks.</p>
      <div class="insight">Fraud/AML teams partnered with cyber to translate indicators (wallets, domains, IPs) into controls and enriched SAR narratives with blockchain‑analytics context. Payment operations enforced cooling‑off periods for first‑time beneficiaries, and customer‑education campaigns focused on phishing and remote‑access tool abuse to reduce social‑engineering success.</div>

      <h3>Business‑email compromise and vendor fraud</h3>
      <p>Invoice‑rerouting and payroll‑diversion schemes remained prevalent, exploiting weak verification of change‑of‑bank‑details requests.</p>
      <div class="insight">Banks and corporates implemented call‑back verification on independent numbers, velocity limits for first‑time payees, positive‑pay/allow‑lists, and stronger MFA on finance workflows. Case notes captured root‑cause factors to drive control improvements and support potential recovery actions.</div>

      <h3>Crypto investment scams and pig‑butchering precursors</h3>
      <p>Authorities flagged rising complaints about high‑yield crypto schemes promoted via social media and messaging apps.</p>
      <div class="insight">Onboarding controls for retail investment platforms were tightened, with enhanced checks on source‑of‑funds and beneficiary profiling. Monitoring focused on rapid exchange deposits followed by off‑platform withdrawals and unusual P2P activity; consumer warnings and takedown coordination with platforms helped blunt losses.</div>
