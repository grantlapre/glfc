      <p>This issue captures key developments across Anti‑Money Laundering (AML), Counter‑Financing of Terrorism (CFT), and Fraud & Financial Crime as at 31 August 2020.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>AML — Regulatory &amp; Policy Developments</h2>
      <h3>FinCEN ANPRM on AML Program Effectiveness (25 Aug)</h3>
      <p>FinCEN issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking input on shifting U.S. AML programs toward risk‑based effectiveness, including the idea of ‘national AML priorities’.</p>
      <div class="insight">The ANPRM signalled a potential reorientation of U.S. AML expectations—from box‑ticking toward demonstrable outcomes tied to clearly articulated national priorities. For institutions, it foreshadowed program updates touching risk assessments, model governance, and metrics used by boards and auditors to evidence effectiveness. It also encouraged early alignment across fraud, sanctions, and cyber teams so risk intelligence could be channelled into priority‑driven monitoring and reporting.</div>

      <h3>EU 6AMLD preparation intensifies</h3>
      <p>With the December transposition deadline approaching, firms accelerated readiness for 6AMLD’s expanded offence scope, aiding and abetting liability, and tougher penalties.</p>
      <div class="insight">August became a planning crunch point as legal and compliance teams mapped gaps against 6AMLD’s broadened list of predicate offences and clarified roles in corporate liability. Institutions prioritised training for investigative teams, refreshed escalation procedures for serious crimes, and coordinated with subsidiaries to ensure consistent case handling and record‑keeping across the EU.</div>

      <h3>Germany outlines supervisory reforms post‑Wirecard</h3>
      <p>German authorities discussed strengthening audit oversight and supervisory coordination in response to Wirecard’s collapse.</p>
      <div class="insight">Regulatory debate turned into concrete planning for audit and market‑supervision reform. Banks and PSPs anticipated tighter scrutiny of outsourcing, third‑party arrangements, and safeguarding of customer funds. Boards were urged to stress‑test governance around revenue recognition and partner relationships in payment ecosystems that had previously been considered lower risk.</div>

      <h2>CFT — Counter‑Terrorism Financing</h2>
      <h3>UN/OFAC terrorism sanctions updates</h3>
      <p>Multiple August listings and amendments targeted ISIL/Al‑Qaida affiliates and Iran‑linked networks, necessitating screening updates and customer outreach where exposure existed.</p>
      <div class="insight">The continued cadence of designations underscored the need for automated list ingestion and cross‑system reconciliation to avoid latency. Compliance teams refined playbooks for rapid triage of potential matches, ensuring front‑line operations could pause transactions, escalate quickly, and document decisions for audit and regulatory review.</div>

      <h3>Heightened vigilance on virtual assets in TF</h3>
      <p>Authorities reiterated concerns about small‑value virtual‑asset transfers and mixing services facilitating TF flows.</p>
      <div class="insight">As physical movement was constrained, TF networks experimented with micro‑transactions and privacy‑enhancing tools. Institutions expanded rules to aggregate low‑value activity across related wallets, applied enhanced due diligence to VASP relationships, and embedded blockchain analytics outputs into SAR narratives to preserve investigative value.</div>

      <h2>Fraud &amp; Financial Crime — Cases &amp; Trends</h2>
      <h3>Wirecard investigations broaden</h3>
      <p>German prosecutors and regulators expanded probes into accounting fraud, oversight failures, and potential market manipulation linked to the payments group.</p>
      <div class="insight">The widening scope made clear that compliance responsibilities extend beyond classic AML. Firms re‑examined whistleblowing effectiveness, third‑party monitoring, and the independence of control functions in fast‑growing fintechs. Payment processors and issuers also reviewed merchant due diligence and ongoing monitoring for programme managers and agents.</div>

      <h3>COVID‑19 relief fraud persists</h3>
      <p>Authorities in multiple jurisdictions pursued cases involving false claims, identity theft, and organised mule networks moving relief funds.</p>
      <div class="insight">By late summer, schemes had matured into coordinated rings using synthetic identities, digital account opening, and rapid pass‑through of funds. Banks adjusted thresholds to official disbursement calendars, deployed device/IP fingerprinting to link accounts, and strengthened mule‑account interdiction with targeted outreach to at‑risk demographics.</div>

      <h3>Twitter hack lessons ripple</h3>
      <p>Following July’s high‑profile compromise, August saw continued proceedings and industry guidance on social‑engineering and insider risks.</p>
      <div class="insight">The incident highlighted that social‑engineering of privileged users can bypass technical controls. Financial institutions refreshed privileged‑access management, introduced high‑risk change ‘hold’ periods, and integrated IT security alerts into financial‑crime monitoring so account‑takeover attempts could be intercepted sooner.</div>
