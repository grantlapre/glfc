    <section>
      <p>This issue captures key developments across Anti‑Money Laundering (AML), Counter‑Financing of Terrorism (CFT), and Fraud & Financial Crime as at 31 October 2019.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>AML — Regulatory &amp; Policy Developments</h2>
      <h3>FATF October Plenary — monitoring outcomes and follow‑ups</h3>
      <p>FATF concluded its October meeting with updates to jurisdictions under increased monitoring and reiterated calls for stronger effectiveness across national AML/CFT regimes.</p>
      <div class="insight">Institutions refreshed country‑risk scores, re‑checked correspondent exposure, and confirmed that EDD triggers reflected the latest FATF outcomes. Transaction‑monitoring rules were tuned for higher‑risk corridors, and governance packs to boards began emphasising effectiveness measures—useful SARs and timely interdictions—over raw alert volumes.</div>

      <h3>EU 5AMLD — supervisory follow‑through and registry usage</h3>
      <p>Supervisors pressed firms to demonstrate practical use of beneficial‑ownership registers in onboarding and periodic reviews, not merely to show access credentials.</p>
      <div class="insight">Compliance teams embedded registry checks in workflow tools, reconciled discrepancies with customer attestations, and documented how ownership data changed risk ratings, EDD scope, and relationship decisions. Exception handling and evidence standards were tightened to withstand audit and supervisory challenge.</div>

      <h3>6AMLD preparation — liability and predicate‑offence scope</h3>
      <p>Firms progressed gap‑analyses for 6AMLD’s broader predicate offences, aiding/abetting and attempt provisions, and tougher, harmonised penalties ahead of 2020 transposition.</p>
      <div class="insight">Investigations, legal and HR aligned on case‑handling playbooks, escalation thresholds, and record‑keeping. Training pipelines prioritised serious‑crime typologies and evidentiary discipline so case files can support potential prosecution.</div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>CFT — Counter‑Terrorism Financing</h2>
      <h3>Sanctions list maintenance across UN/EU/US regimes</h3>
      <p>October brought routine terrorism‑related listings and amendments, requiring prompt screening hygiene and consistent match management.</p>
      <div class="insight">Institutions validated daily (or better) ingestion of list updates across customer, payments and trade‑finance screening, rehearsed pause‑and‑review procedures, and improved documentation so alert decisions were audit‑ready while keeping clean traffic flowing.</div>

      <h3>Focus on small‑value flows, NPOs, and online fundraising</h3>
      <p>Authorities reiterated that terrorist networks exploit micro‑donations, online platforms, and informal transfer systems to evade controls.</p>
      <div class="insight">Monitoring scenarios were tuned to detect aggregation across linked accounts and channels. Analysts were coached to capture contextual elements—beneficiary links, geography, and stated purpose—in SAR narratives to preserve investigative value for FIUs.</div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Fraud &amp; Financial Crime — Cases &amp; Trends</h2>
      <h3>Holiday‑season fraud ramps up</h3>
      <p>Card‑not‑present fraud, account takeover, and social‑engineering schemes rose heading into year‑end shopping peaks.</p>
      <div class="insight">Fraud teams layered device fingerprinting and behavioural analytics with velocity controls for first‑time payees and merchants. Customer‑education campaigns targeted phishing and OTP interception, while payment operations implemented cooling‑off periods and call‑back verification for high‑risk beneficiary changes.</div>

      <h3>Ransomware and BEC continue to pressure enterprises</h3>
      <p>Municipalities and corporates reported disruptive ransomware incidents and persistent business‑email compromise targeting payment workflows.</p>
      <div class="insight">AML/fraud worked with cyber teams to translate indicators—domains, IPs, wallets—into monitoring controls. SAR narratives incorporated blockchain‑analytics context for crypto cash‑outs and captured control gaps that could inform recovery or remediation efforts.</div>

      <h3>Money‑mule recruitment and APP scams</h3>
      <p>Recruitment of mules via social media and messaging apps accelerated ahead of holiday cash‑out cycles, fuelling authorised push‑payment fraud.</p>
      <div class="insight">Banks used device, IP, and behavioural analytics to identify mule clusters, tightened beneficiary‑change safeguards, and deployed confirmation‑of‑payee with contextual warnings. Targeted education campaigns aimed to reduce victim readiness to authorise fraudulent transfers.</div>
