      <p>This issue captures key developments across Anti‑Money Laundering (AML), Counter‑Financing of Terrorism (CFT), and Fraud & Financial Crime as at 30 September 2019.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>AML — Regulatory &amp; Policy Developments</h2>
      <h3>VASPs — national licensing and travel‑rule roadmaps emerge</h3>
      <p>Following FATF’s June guidance, several jurisdictions outlined registration/licensing paths for exchanges and custodial wallets, and consulted on technical standards for the travel‑rule.</p>
      <div class="insight">Banks inventoried exposure to crypto‑native firms and payment processors, defined EDD triggers for high‑risk patterns, and scoped messaging solutions for originator/beneficiary data. Correspondent and acquiring partners reviewed onboarding standards to prevent risk transfer via nested processors or obfuscated flows.</div>

      <h3>EU 5AMLD — supervisory follow‑through and data quality</h3>
      <p>Supervisors extended their focus from registry access to the quality and consistency of beneficial‑ownership records used in KYC and reviews.</p>
      <div class="insight">Programs embedded registry look‑ups into workflow tools, reconciled discrepancies with client attestations, and tightened exception handling with explicit SLAs. MI dashboards began tracking how ownership data changed risk ratings, EDD scope, and SAR narratives to evidence effectiveness.</div>

      <h3>6AMLD preparation — predicate‑offence coverage and corporate liability</h3>
      <p>Firms advanced gap‑analyses for the broader predicate‑offence list and corporate‑liability provisions ahead of 2020 transposition deadlines.</p>
      <div class="insight">Investigations, legal, and HR clarified roles and escalation thresholds for complex cases and codified record‑keeping standards. Training highlighted serious‑crime typologies and evidentiary discipline so case files could withstand prosecutorial scrutiny.</div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>CFT — Counter‑Terrorism Financing</h2>
      <h3>Sanctions maintenance — routine listings across UN/EU/US</h3>
      <p>September brought standard terrorism‑related amendments requiring rapid watchlist updates and consistent alert management.</p>
      <div class="insight">Institutions validated near‑real‑time ingestion across screening engines, rehearsed pause‑and‑review procedures, and improved documentation quality so decisions were audit‑ready without impeding clean traffic.</div>

      <h3>Small‑value flows and online fundraising vigilance</h3>
      <p>Authorities reiterated risk signals around micro‑donations, informal value transfer, and online platforms linked to higher‑risk corridors.</p>
      <div class="insight">Monitoring scenarios were tuned to detect aggregation across linked accounts and channels; analysts emphasised geography, beneficiary links, and purpose in SAR narratives to preserve investigative value for FIUs.</div>

    <section>
      <h2>Fraud &amp; Financial Crime — Cases &amp; Trends</h2>
      <h3>Ransomware and cyber‑enabled fraud — persistent pressure</h3>
      <p>Organisations reported steady ransomware incidents with proceeds laundered through mule networks and crypto cash‑outs.</p>
      <div class="insight">AML/fraud teams integrated cyber indicators (wallets, domains, IPs) into monitoring, enforced cooling‑off periods for first‑time beneficiaries, and strengthened customer education on phishing and remote‑access tool abuse. SARs increasingly included blockchain‑analytics indicators to aid tracing.</div>

      <h3>Deepfake‑style social engineering and voice spoofing</h3>
      <p>Cases of voice‑cloning and synthetic audio showed vulnerabilities in verbal approvals and call‑back verification.</p>
      <div class="insight">Programs adopted out‑of‑band confirmation and multi‑person sign‑off for high‑risk changes, piloted behavioural/biometric checks, and trained finance staff to recognise urgency ploys and unusual phrasing indicative of spoofing.</div>

      <h3>Authorised push‑payment fraud and mule recruitment</h3>
      <p>APP scams targeted SMEs and consumers via spoofed supplier invoices and romance/investment schemes, fuelling mule account activity.</p>
      <div class="insight">Banks tightened beneficiary‑change safeguards, deployed confirmation‑of‑payee and contextual warnings, and coordinated with peers to identify mule clusters using device, IP, and behavioural analytics.</div>
