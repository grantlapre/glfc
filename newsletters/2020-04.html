    <section>
      <p>This issue captures key developments across Anti‑Money Laundering (AML), Counter‑Financing of Terrorism (CFT), and Fraud &amp; Financial Crime as at 31 March 2020.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>AML — Regulatory &amp; Policy Developments</h2>
      <h3>FinCEN Advisory on FATF‑deficient jurisdictions</h3>
      <p>FinCEN alerted U.S. institutions to risks from countries newly listed by FATF, including Albania, Barbados, Jamaica, Mauritius, Myanmar, Nicaragua, and Uganda.</p>
      <div class="insight">The advisory required banks to reassess customer and transaction risk exposures tied to these jurisdictions immediately. It reinforced that FATF statements have direct, program‑level consequences: enhanced due diligence files needed refreshing, risk scores needed updating, and correspondent relationships warranted renewed scrutiny. The specificity of the listing also highlighted how quickly the global risk landscape can shift, pushing compliance programs to be agile in policy updates and system tuning.</div>

      <h3>EU/UK supervisors on AML continuity during COVID‑19 disruptions</h3>
      <p>Authorities reiterated that AML/CFT obligations remained fully in force despite operational challenges created by the pandemic.</p>
      <div class="insight">This intervention made clear that financial‑crime controls could not be relaxed in a crisis. Institutions were expected to maintain SAR timeliness, keep monitoring systems effective despite remote operations, and adapt customer due‑diligence processes using digital tools. For compliance leaders, it underscored the value of business‑continuity planning, secure communications for investigations, and governance frameworks capable of sustaining performance under stress.</div>

      <h3>AUSTRAC consultation activity</h3>
      <p>Australia’s AUSTRAC advanced proposals to strengthen reporting obligations and extend AML/CTF rules to additional sectors.</p>
      <div class="insight">The consultation signalled continued alignment with international standards, especially for designated non‑financial businesses and professions. Firms had an opportunity to inform policy while preparing for tighter coverage of real estate, professional services, and high‑value dealers. Many used the period to benchmark gaps, test readiness for expanded reporting, and anticipate the supervisory focus that would follow.</div>

      <h2>CFT — Counter‑Terrorism Financing</h2>
      <h3>FATF monitoring posture reiterated</h3>
      <p>Following the February Plenary, FATF guidance confirmed that countermeasures against Iran remained in effect and Pakistan stayed under increased monitoring.</p>
      <div class="insight">The update stressed that geopolitical complexity did not excuse lapses in vigilance. For institutions, this meant sustaining controls around correspondent banking, wire transfers, and due diligence relating to high‑risk countries. Teams needed to track evolving FATF statements and translate them rapidly into screening rules, EDD triggers, and outreach to higher‑risk counterparties.</div>

      <h3>Pandemic‑related TF risks</h3>
      <p>Early signals in March indicated extremist groups attempting to exploit COVID‑19 supply chains and fundraising narratives.</p>
      <div class="insight">The warnings showed that terrorist financiers moved quickly to exploit humanitarian narratives and disrupted supply chains. Banks were encouraged to scrutinise new charities, trace cross‑border donations, and monitor payments tied to medical goods where pricing or volumes seemed atypical. Collaboration with FIUs and peers became vital to surface emerging typologies before they scaled.</div>

      <h2>Fraud &amp; Financial Crime — Cases &amp; Trends</h2>
      <h3>Travelex ransomware fallout</h3>
      <p>Recovery from the January cyberattack continued, disrupting FX services and generating high costs.</p>
      <div class="insight">The Travelex incident illustrated how cyber events cascade into financial‑crime exposure. Prolonged disruption revealed weaknesses in third‑party dependency management and resilience planning. Many institutions used it as a prompt to integrate cyber indicators into AML/fraud workflows and to test manual fallbacks for sanctions screening and KYC where systems were impaired.</div>

      <h3>Wawa breach card data for sale</h3>
      <p>Up to 30 million cards compromised in the December 2019 breach were listed on Joker’s Stash in March.</p>
      <div class="insight">This showed the long‑tail nature of breach fallout. Criminals monetised stolen data months later, requiring issuers and acquirers to remain vigilant well after initial disclosures. Effective responses combined proactive customer education, velocity checks, device/IP analytics, and coordinated re‑issuance strategies to constrain downstream losses.</div>

      <h3>COVID‑19 PPE fraud emerges</h3>
      <p>Law‑enforcement actions seized tens of thousands of counterfeit masks and disrupted scams targeting medical supplies.</p>
      <div class="insight">Fraud networks pivoted rapidly to medical supply chains, leveraging shell entities, unverifiable certifications, and high‑pressure sales tied to scarcity. Banks recalibrated monitoring rules, scrutinised new counterparties, and built trade‑finance red flags into workflows to validate provenance before releasing funds.</div>

      <h3>Airbus global settlement lessons</h3>
      <p>Analysts in March dissected the €3.6bn January bribery settlement, focusing on compliance lessons.</p>
      <div class="insight">The Airbus settlement became a benchmark for multi‑jurisdictional enforcement and cooperation. It highlighted the value regulators place on robust remediation, documentation, and a credible culture of compliance. Many firms revisited third‑party risk programs and speaking‑up mechanisms in light of the case.</div>
