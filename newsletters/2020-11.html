      <p>This issue captures key developments across Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Counter-Financing of Terrorism (CFT), and Fraud & Financial Crime as at 31 October 2020.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>AML — Regulatory &amp; Policy Developments</h2>
      <h3>FATF October Plenary Outcomes</h3>
      <p>FATF announced updates on high-risk jurisdictions: Iceland was removed from the grey list, while countries including Pakistan, Panama, and others remained under increased monitoring. Iran and DPRK continued under call-for-action status.</p>
      <div class="insight">The outcomes required institutions to refresh country risk scores and adapt onboarding/monitoring policies. For compliance teams, it was another reminder of how dynamic FATF’s list remains. Institutions reinforced enhanced due diligence for exposed customers and reviewed correspondent banking corridors in light of persistent calls for countermeasures.</div>

      <h3>European Commission — Roadmap Toward EU AML Authority</h3>
      <p>The Commission outlined its timeline to propose an EU-level AML supervisor in 2021.</p>
      <div class="insight">The move signalled irreversible momentum toward centralised oversight. Cross-border banks accelerated internal alignment, ensuring data and governance structures would withstand direct EU scrutiny. The announcement also prompted smaller national supervisors to collaborate more closely in anticipation of an eventual transfer of responsibilities.</div>

      <h3>FinCEN ANPRM Comment Period (closed 16 Nov)</h3>
      <p>October was the final month for industry to prepare feedback on FinCEN’s proposal to anchor AML programs around national priorities and effectiveness.</p>
      <div class="insight">Institutions prioritised board-level engagement, drafting comment letters, and anticipating operational impacts. For many, the process forced reflection on how to demonstrate effectiveness through metrics, case studies, and law-enforcement feedback rather than only policy documents.</div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>CFT — Counter‑Terrorism Financing</h2>
      <h3>UN &amp; OFAC Sanctions Updates</h3>
      <p>October brought designations targeting terrorist groups in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.</p>
      <div class="insight">The pace of designations underscored the need for automated, real-time list ingestion and reconciliation across business lines. Banks emphasised cross-functional coordination between sanctions teams and AML operations to ensure efficient triage of alerts and documentation for audit trails.</div>

      <h3>FATF Report on Terrorist Financing Risk Indicators</h3>
      <p>FATF issued guidance to help institutions identify TF linked to non-profit organisations and informal value transfer systems.</p>
      <div class="insight">This guidance was particularly timely amid pandemic-driven humanitarian campaigns. Institutions were encouraged to refine monitoring for small donations, frequent cash deposits, and fund transfers to higher-risk regions. Compliance teams enhanced training modules to help staff spot subtle TF indicators in routine transactions.</div>

      <h2>Fraud &amp; Financial Crime — Cases &amp; Trends</h2>
      <h3>Westpac Settlement with AUSTRAC</h3>
      <p>In late October, Westpac agreed to pay AUD 1.3 billion to settle breaches of AML/CTF laws, the largest penalty in Australian corporate history.</p>
      <div class="insight">The settlement highlighted regulators’ willingness to pursue record penalties and emphasised board accountability. It reinforced the importance of transaction-monitoring effectiveness, child exploitation typology detection, and escalation processes. Institutions globally reviewed their reporting backlogs and governance in light of the case.</div>

      <h3>COVID-19 Fraud Evolves</h3>
      <p>Authorities reported continued phishing campaigns, PPE fraud, and misuse of government relief funds.</p>
      <div class="insight">By autumn, fraudsters refined tactics, using sophisticated websites, professional-looking invoices, and layered mule networks. Banks had to recalibrate transaction monitoring, strengthen customer education, and coordinate with industry ISACs to share timely intelligence.</div>

      <h3>Danske Bank &amp; Ongoing Probes</h3>
      <p>European regulators continued investigations into Danske Bank and other Nordic institutions.</p>
      <div class="insight">The persistence of these probes emphasised the long tail of AML failures. Boards across Europe reassessed oversight of subsidiaries and correspondent banking, preparing for higher expectations on cross-border accountability.</div>
