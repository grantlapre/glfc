      <p>This issue captures key developments across Anti‑Money Laundering (AML), Counter‑Financing of Terrorism (CFT), and Fraud & Financial Crime as at 30 November 2020.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>AML — Regulatory &amp; Policy Developments</h2>
      <h3>EU 6AMLD — last‑mile readiness</h3>
      <p>With the 6th Anti‑Money Laundering Directive transposition deadline in early December, institutions finalised gap‑closing for the expanded list of predicate offences, aiding/abetting liability, and tougher penalties.</p>
      <div class="insight">November was a final sprint for legal and compliance teams to align policies, case‑handling playbooks, and record‑keeping with 6AMLD’s scope. Groups harmonised approaches across EU subsidiaries, clarified roles for corporate criminal liability, and refreshed training for investigations staff who would face higher thresholds for escalation and documentation.</div>

      <h3>Beneficial‑ownership transparency momentum</h3>
      <p>EU and U.S. policy debates continued to converge on stronger company‑ownership transparency and effectiveness‑focused AML programs.</p>
      <div class="insight">Institutions anticipated that central registries and clearer national priorities would reshape KYC workflows. Compliance leaders prepared to integrate registry data where available, reconcile discrepancies against customer attestations, and evidence how verified ownership information improves risk assessments and SAR narrative quality.</div>

      <h3>Supervisory focus on program effectiveness</h3>
      <p>Supervisors across multiple jurisdictions emphasised outcomes—quality of investigations, useful SARs, and measurable disruption of illicit networks—over process volume.</p>
      <div class="insight">Boards asked for clearer MI on alert quality, tuning, and case outcomes. Functions responded by tightening model‑risk governance for monitoring systems, defining effectiveness KPIs beyond counts, and strengthening feedback loops with FIUs and law enforcement.</div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>CFT — Counter‑Terrorism Financing</h2>
      <h3>UN / OFAC sanctions activity</h3>
      <p>November saw continued listings and amendments relating to ISIL/Al‑Qaida affiliates and regional networks, requiring prompt screening updates.</p>
      <div class="insight">The sustained cadence underscored the need for automated list ingestion and reconciled screening tools to avoid latency. Front‑line teams rehearsed pause‑and‑review procedures and sharpened documentation of alert disposition to withstand audit and supervisory scrutiny.</div>

      <h3>Heightened attention to small‑value flows and virtual assets</h3>
      <p>Authorities reiterated that TF networks leverage micro‑donations, informal value transfer, and virtual‑asset rails to circumvent traditional controls.</p>
      <div class="insight">Firms expanded surveillance logic to aggregate small payments across linked accounts and wallets, applied EDD to VASP relationships, and incorporated blockchain‑analytics indicators into SAR narratives to preserve investigative value.</div>

      <h2>Fraud &amp; Financial Crime — Cases &amp; Trends</h2>
      <h3>Pandemic fraud pivots to vaccines and logistics</h3>
      <p>As vaccine approvals neared, authorities flagged phishing, pre‑order scams, and counterfeit vaccine offers alongside ongoing PPE and relief‑fund fraud.</p>
      <div class="insight">Criminals adapted quickly to new demand signals, standing up professional‑looking websites and layered mule networks to capture deposits and launder proceeds. Banks refreshed monitoring scenarios around healthcare suppliers and logistics, tightened controls for newly onboarded counterparties, and expanded customer education to blunt social‑engineering attacks.</div>

      <h3>Ransomware and BEC remain elevated</h3>
      <p>Financial institutions reported persistent ransomware targeting remote infrastructure and continued business‑email compromise against payment workflows.</p>
      <div class="insight">Programs integrated IT security telemetry (EDR alerts, anomalous logins) into financial‑crime monitoring so potential account takeovers could be intercepted before funds moved. Payment operations implemented call‑back verification for change‑of‑details requests and imposed cooling‑off periods on high‑risk beneficiary changes.</div>

      <h3>Cross‑border laundering networks under scrutiny</h3>
      <p>International investigations into professional money‑laundering networks progressed, building on arrests and seizures announced earlier in the autumn.</p>
      <div class="insight">Institutions used the enforcement tempo to stress‑test correspondent banking due diligence, refresh typology libraries on cash‑intensive businesses and money mules, and coordinate with peers through information‑sharing partnerships.</div>
