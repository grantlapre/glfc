      <p>This issue captures key developments across Anti‑Money Laundering (AML), Counter‑Financing of Terrorism (CFT), and Fraud & Financial Crime as at 31 July 2019.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>AML — Regulatory &amp; Policy Developments</h2>
      <h3>FATF follow‑up — VASP supervision begins</h3>
      <p>After finalising virtual‑asset guidance in June, jurisdictions began implementing licensing/registration frameworks for exchanges and custodial wallets.</p>
      <div class="insight">Institutions inventoried crypto‑exposed customers, defined EDD thresholds, and tested transaction‑monitoring scenarios for exchange‑to‑exchange flows and mixer usage. Supervisors stressed that failure to prepare for the travel rule would invite scrutiny and potential restrictions on correspondent access.</div>

      <h3>EU 5AMLD enforcement — registry usage and reporting</h3>
      <p>Supervisors examined how obliged entities accessed and applied beneficial‑ownership registers to onboarding and periodic reviews.</p>
      <div class="insight">Banks documented workflows that compared registry data against client attestations, defined exception‑handling steps, and built audit trails to show how ownership data informed risk ratings and SAR decisions. National supervisors warned that passive registry access without evidence of use would not be sufficient.</div>

      <h3>6AMLD preparation — liability expansion</h3>
      <p>Firms advanced planning for 6AMLD’s new corporate‑liability provisions and broader predicate‑offence list.</p>
      <div class="insight">Investigations, legal, and compliance aligned on liability mapping, case‑handling playbooks, and record‑keeping standards. Training emphasised the wider scope of criminal conduct and how escalation thresholds should be set in complex cases.</div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>CFT — Counter‑Terrorism Financing</h2>
      <h3>UN/EU/US sanctions list maintenance</h3>
      <p>July saw routine terrorism‑related designations and amendments, requiring rapid screening updates and consistent match‑management discipline.</p>
      <div class="insight">Institutions tightened ingestion cadences and verified propagation of list updates across customer, payments, and trade‑finance screening. Documentation quality was reinforced to show reasoning behind each alert decision, ensuring audit‑readiness while maintaining efficient processing.</div>

      <h3>NPO scrutiny and online fundraising risks</h3>
      <p>Authorities warned of terrorist groups exploiting online platforms and informal channels for small recurring donations.</p>
      <div class="insight">Monitoring was tuned to capture aggregation across linked accounts and merchant categories. SARs included contextual details such as geography, beneficiary links, and transaction purposes to aid FIU analysis and law‑enforcement follow‑up.</div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Fraud &amp; Financial Crime — Cases &amp; Trends</h2>
      <h3>Ransomware and cyber‑enabled fraud escalate</h3>
      <p>Municipalities and enterprises continued to report disruptive ransomware incidents, with demands increasingly denominated in crypto.</p>
      <div class="insight">AML/fraud teams enriched SARs with blockchain‑analytics indicators, enforced cooling‑off periods for first‑time beneficiaries, and strengthened customer awareness campaigns against phishing and remote‑access tools. Information‑sharing with peers helped track mule networks linked to ransomware cash‑outs.</div>

      <h3>Business‑email compromise persists</h3>
      <p>Invoice‑rerouting and payroll‑diversion schemes remained common, with fraudsters exploiting weak verification practices.</p>
      <div class="insight">Banks and corporates enforced call‑back verification on independent contacts, monitored first‑time payments more closely, and used positive‑pay/allow‑list controls. Fraud casework captured root causes to inform systemic improvements.</div>

      <h3>Crypto‑investment scams rise</h3>
      <p>Authorities flagged more retail losses from fraudulent crypto‑investment offerings promoted on social media and messaging apps.</p>
      <div class="insight">Institutions tightened onboarding checks on retail platforms, applied EDD for rapid exchange deposits and withdrawals, and issued public warnings. Collaboration with tech platforms aimed to remove scam promotions more quickly.</div>
